# FIRST PART

## CONDOMINIUM: DEFINITION, LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES

# Chapter 1 – Condominium in Moroccan law: Condominium legislation

Condominium management requires the establishment of an appropriate legal framework and structures designed to perpetuate this real estate heritage and to encourage real estate developers to invest in it.

To this end, **law 18-00** relating to the status of condominium of built buildings which came into force on **November 7, 2003** provided the framework and legal tools to achieve these objectives, by precisely defining the components of condominium as well as the rights and obligations of co-owners, and by providing this institution with adequate bodies, of which the syndicate and the condominium syndic constitute fundamental components.

## 1 – Scope of application of the condominium law

According to article one of law 18-00, the provisions of said law apply to the ownership of built buildings divided by apartments, floors or premises and whose ownership belonging to several persons is distributed by lots each comprising a private part and a share of the common parts.

They also apply to built real estate complexes and to the various residences consisting of contiguous or separate dwellings having common parts belonging in indivision to all co-owners.

These provisions apply to both registered or in the process of registration buildings as well as those not registered.

Furthermore, according to article 46 of law 18-00, the provisions of this law apply to housing cooperatives and associations. These are required, for this purpose, to develop condominium regulations.

In case of dissolution of the cooperative or association, a syndicate composed of members of the cooperative or association is created by right, due to the existence of common parts allocated to common use.

## 2 – Components of condominium

### 2.1 – Private parts

Are considered as private parts of buildings, the built or unbuilt parts belonging to each co-owner for the purpose of enjoying them individually and personally.

They are the exclusive property of each co-owner.

### 2.2 – Common parts

Are considered as common parts of buildings, the built or unbuilt parts intended for the use and enjoyment of all co-owners or some of them.

**Are deemed common parts:**

- the ground
- the structural work of the building, foundations, load-bearing walls and basements whatever their depth
- the facade of the building
- roofs intended for common use
- stairs, passages and corridors intended for common use
- guardians' and caretakers' lodges
- entrances, basements and elevators intended for common use
- walls and partitions separating two apartments or premises
- common equipment, including the parts thereof that pass through the private parts
- vaults, chimney heads and ventilation outlets intended for common use

**Are also considered as common parts, except stipulation in the property titles or in case of contradiction between these titles:**

- roofs and balconies not initially allocated to individual use
- courtyards and gardens
- premises intended for common use

And in general, any part considered as such or that the nature of the building requires it to be intended for common use.

**Are considered as accessory rights to common parts:**

- the right to raise the building
- the right to erect new constructions in courtyards or gardens and in their basements
- the right of excavation

## 3 – Rights and obligations of co-owners

### 3.1 – Rights of co-owners

#### 3.1.1 – Individual rights

Every co-owner has the right to:

- freely and fully dispose of their divided part of the building as well as the undivided parts attached to it according to its allocation, whether it concerns sale, bequest or others
- access archives, syndicate registers, particularly those relating to the treasury situation
- take legal action to preserve their rights in the condominium building

#### 3.1.2 – Collective rights

**Right of preference:** co-owners may, by a majority of three-quarters of the votes, establish among themselves a right of preference regarding all acts of property transfer and provide for the modalities of exercise of said right and its deadlines in the condominium regulations.

**Right of raising, excavation and reconstruction of the building:** on condition of being authorized by the regulations in force, the exercise of this right must be approved unanimously by the co-owners.

When it concerns partial destruction, the decision to restore the damaged part is made by a majority of three-quarters of the co-owners' votes.

#### 3.1.3 – Rights of tenants

The co-owner who has leased their divided fraction is required to give the tenant a copy of the condominium regulations. The tenant undertakes to respect the regulations of which they have taken knowledge and the decisions made by the co-owners' syndicate. An article covering these stipulations must be inserted in the lease contract.

It should be specified in this regard that the co-owner is personally responsible for paying contributions to charges in case of rental.

### 3.2 – Obligations of co-owners

#### 3.2.1 – Participation in charges

Each of the co-owners is required to participate in charges relating to the conservation, maintenance and management of common parts.

Except for contrary provisions in the condominium regulations, charges relating to the conservation, maintenance and management of common parts are fixed according to the share of each co-owner's divided part in relation to the building.

The modification of the distribution of common charges can only be decided by the general assembly by a majority of three-quarters of the co-owners' votes.

In case a co-owner considers that their participation in charges is higher than their due, they may bring the dispute before the competent court to request its revision.

In this case, the lawsuit is brought against the co-owners' syndicate in the presence, if applicable, of the syndic. In case of transfer of a divided part, the transferee is jointly responsible with the transferor towards the syndicate to guarantee payment of the syndicate's claims due by the transferring member.

The syndicate's claims relating to common charges against co-owners are prescribed, if they are not claimed, within two years from their approval by the general assembly.

#### 3.2.2 – Execution of works on undivided parts

The co-owner, their successors or the occupant must not prohibit works relating to undivided parts decided by the general assembly, even if they are carried out inside the divided parts.

The syndic is required to inform the co-owner or their successors or the occupant, of the nature of the works eight days before their start, unless it concerns urgent works aimed at preserving the safety of the condominium building and that of its occupants.

In case of refusal by one of the co-owners, the dispute may be brought before the emergency judge who may order the execution of necessary works, thus removing the prejudice.

- In case one of the parties refuses to conclude the definitive sales contract within thirty days from the date of the notification referred to above, the injured party may bring legal action for the conclusion of the definitive contract or the termination of the preliminary sales contract

The final judgment ordering the conclusion of the sale is equivalent to a definitive contract.

# SECOND PART

## THE PROPERTY MANAGER AND THEIR MISSION IN CONDOMINIUM MANAGEMENT

# Chapter 1 – The Property Manager

## 1 – Role of the Property Manager

The property manager manages on behalf of the co-owners the assets that are common to them, and executes all the provisions of the condominium regulations for which they are responsible.

Thus, their function encompasses various aspects, namely:

### 1.1 - Legal and Organizational Aspects

- The property manager convenes and organizes the general assembly of co-owners,
- They execute decisions made in this context,
- They enforce the condominium regulations,
- They can initiate legal proceedings against a co-owner or a third party (with authorization from the general assembly),
- They are the permanent representative of the co-owners' syndicate,
- They maintain the condominium archives.

### 1.2 - Financial Aspects

- The property manager manages the condominium's financial resources,
- They allocate charges among co-owners
- They collect provisions for charges,
- They pay suppliers,
- They handle cash flow problems and accounting.
- They present the forecast budget to the general assembly.

### 1.3 - Technical Aspects

The property manager is responsible, for common areas:

- for maintenance of premises;
- for preventive maintenance and repairs;
- They negotiate interventions with different trades and control the execution of work. They submit quotes to the general assembly;
- They manage security or maintenance personnel (concierge).

It should be noted in this regard that the profession of condominium property manager is regulated in several countries.

Thus, in the case of France, the condominium property manager must possess a professional card to be renewed annually and for this, they must:

- justify their professional aptitude to exercise this profession;
- provide a financial guarantee intended to secure the funds held;
- be insured for professional civil liability against pecuniary risks incurred;
- be registered in the commercial register;
- not be subject to a prohibition to practice as defined by law.

As for our country, the function is exercised in most cases by co-owner property managers.

Professional property managers are emerging more and more, but there is no legal obligation to use these property managers and recourse to their services remains quite limited.

Given the legal framework introduced by Law 18-00, the role granted by this Law to the condominium property manager and the need for professional upgrading of this category of stakeholders to enable them to properly fulfill this role, the Ministry of Housing, Urban Planning and Spatial Development has organized a training cycle for this category of stakeholder.

## 2 – Designation of the Property Manager

The property manager and their deputy are designated by the general assembly, from among the co-owners present or represented, by majority vote.

They can be designated, by the same majority, from among third parties and can be a natural or legal person exercising the profession of real estate management in a liberal capacity.

In the absence of the designation of a property manager and their deputy, they are appointed at the request of one or more co-owners by the president of the court of first instance after having informed all co-owners and heard those present among them.

The property manager and their deputy are appointed for a renewable period of two years.

## 3 – Duties of the Property Manager

The property manager is charged in particular with:

- executing the provisions of the condominium regulations for which they are assigned;
- implementing the decisions of the general assembly, unless they are entrusted to the syndical council, to the owners or to third parties;
- ensuring proper use of common areas by ensuring their maintenance, guarding the main entrances of the building and common equipment;
- carrying out urgent repairs even on their own initiative;
- preparing the syndicate's budget project for examination and approval by the general assembly;

- regularly establishing the syndicate's budget and maintaining accounting that shows the cash flow situation of the syndicate and each co-owner;
- communicating the syndicate's cash flow situation to co-owners, at least every three months;
- maintaining archives and registers relating to the building and the syndicate and facilitating access to these documents for all co-owners, particularly before holding the general assembly whose agenda includes examination of the syndicate's accounting;
- undertaking administrative procedures that are recognized to them and those that are delegated to them;
- representing the syndicate in court on special order from the general assembly.

## 4 – The Deputy Property Manager

In case of death of the property manager, their revocation or resignation, the deputy property manager exercises the same duties as the property manager.

The deputy property manager temporarily exercises the same duties in case of refusal by the property manager to fulfill their role or when they inform them of their absence or their intention to cease their functions.

In case of dispute, the property manager and their deputy must refer to a general assembly that meets urgently.

The property manager or their deputy is held responsible for non-performance of their tasks.

## 6 – Remuneration of the Property Manager

The general assembly sets the property manager's fees and, where applicable, their remuneration. In default, they are set by the judicial order appointing the property manager.

# Chapter 2 - The Property Manager's Legal Tools: The Condominium Regulations

## 1 – Role of the Condominium Regulations

The condominium regulations represent the statutes of the condominium syndicate. Article 8 of Law 18-00 stipulates in this regard that any condominium building subject to the provisions of said law is governed by condominium regulations.

The original owner or the co-owners by mutual agreement are required to develop condominium regulations in compliance with the provisions of said law. A copy must be given to each co-owner.

In the absence of condominium regulations, standard condominium regulations apply to them; the regulations are developed through regulatory channels.

Co-owners may prescribe special conditions or specific obligations in the condominium regulations subject to the provisions of the law.

## 2 – Development of the Condominium Regulations

Article 21 stipulates for its part that by a majority of three-quarters of the votes of the co-owners, the general assembly rules on the development of condominium regulations if they are not established or their amendment, as the case may be, particularly for common areas, the conditions of their use and enjoyment.

## 3 – Content of the Condominium Regulations

According to the provisions of Article 9 of Law 18-00, the condominium regulations must include the following elements:

- the purpose of private and common areas and the conditions of their use;
- the definition of rules relating to the administration of common areas and the right of enjoyment thereof;
- the definition of rules for managing the syndicate and holding the general assembly as well as the criteria for designating the property manager and their deputy and, where applicable, the syndical council. However, this latter provision is not mandatory if the number of co-owners is less than eight;
- the allocation of indivision quotas relating to common areas to each divided fraction.

## 4 – Documents Annexed to the Condominium Regulations

Article 10 of Law 18-00 stipulates that the following documents are attached to the condominium regulations:

- architectural plans ne varietur;
- approved topographical plans defining individual and common areas.

## 5 – Filing and Publication of the Condominium Regulations

According to Article 11, the condominium regulations to which are annexed the attached documents and any modifications made in accordance with the law must be, for registered buildings, filed and recorded at the land registry office of the location where the building is situated.

If the building is not registered, the condominium regulations with any modifications possibly made to it are filed at the registry office of the court of first instance in the jurisdiction where the building is located.

# Chapter 3 – The Property Manager's Finances

This chapter will be devoted to certain aspects that are related to the property manager's financial management, namely:

- bank accounts;
- check regulations.

## 1 – Bank Accounts

### 1.1 – Nature of Bank Accounts

Deposit accounts comprise 3 categories:

- **sight deposit accounts**: the funds deposited there can be moved mainly by means of checks, bank transfer orders and bank direct debits;
- **passbook accounts**: only the account holder (or their agent) can dispose of the funds deposited there, by means of the passbook given to them by their bank and which serves as the support for this account;
- **term deposit account**: the account holder can only dispose of the funds deposited there at the maturity agreed upon when opening it. It is possible to obtain an advance on the deposited funds from their bank, by paying interest at a rate higher than that received.

### 1.2 – Opening a Bank Account

Opening conditions differ depending on whether it is a natural person or a legal entity.

Regarding the Co-owners' Syndicate, a legal entity, the necessary documents for opening a bank account are as follows:

- copy of the Condominium Regulations certified as conforming to the original;
- copy of the minutes of the general assembly that elected the property manager and their deputy;
- copies of the national identity cards of the property manager and their deputy;
- receipt of declaration to the local authority of the syndicate's constitution.

## 2 – Bank Check Regulations

Bank checks are governed by articles 239 to 328 of the commercial code.

### 2.1 – Form of the Check

The check must necessarily contain the following information:

- the name of the drawee (the bank responsible for paying the check);
- indication of the place where payment must be made;
- indication of the date and place where the check is created;
- the name and signature of the drawer (the holder of the account on which the check is drawn).

A check not conforming to the forms issued by the banking establishment or in which one of the mandatory statements is missing is deemed not valid as a check.

### 2.2 – Payment of the Check

The check is payable at sight. Any contrary mention is deemed unwritten.

A check presented for payment before the day indicated as the issue date is payable on the day of presentation.

A check without indication of the beneficiary is valid as a bearer check.

A check whose amount is written both in words and in figures is valid, in case of difference, for the sum written in words.

A check whose amount is written several times either in words or in figures is valid, in case of difference, only for the lesser sum.

In these two cases, the bank is required to pay the check in accordance with the aforementioned provisions.

If the provision is less than the amount of the check, the drawee banking establishment is required to offer payment up to the amount of available provision.

The drawee cannot refuse this partial payment.

Any person who submits a check for payment must prove their identity by means of an official document bearing their photograph:

**For natural persons:**

- The national identity card;
- The registration card for resident foreigners;
- The passport or any other piece of identity serving as such for non-resident foreigners.

**For legal entities:**

- The identity of the natural person(s) authorized to carry out the aforementioned operation;
- As well as the corporate tax registration number, commercial register or business license tax.

### 2.3 – Transmission of the Check

A check stipulated payable to the benefit of a named person with or without express "to order" clause is transferable by endorsement.

Endorsement transfers all rights resulting from the check and in particular, ownership of the provision.

### 2.4 – Presentation of the Check

A check issued and payable in Morocco must be presented for payment within twenty days. A check issued outside Morocco and payable in Morocco must be presented within sixty days.

The bank must pay the check even after expiration of the presentation period.

### 2.5 – Certification of the Check

Any check for which the corresponding provision exists at the disposal of the drawer must be certified by the drawee if the drawer or bearer requests it.

The provision of the certified check remains, under the drawee's responsibility, blocked for the bearer's benefit until the end of the presentation period.

Certification results from the drawee's signature on the front of the check. It can only be refused for insufficient provision.

### 2.6 – Crossing of the Check

The drawer or bearer of a check may cross it with the effects indicated below.

Crossing is done by means of two parallel bars placed on the front. It can be general or special.

The crossing is general if it bears no designation between the bars or the mention of a banking establishment or equivalent term. Such a check can only be paid by the bank to one of its customers or to a banking establishment.

It is special if the name of a banking establishment is inscribed between the two bars. Such a check can only be paid by the drawee to the designated banking establishment or, if that one is the drawee, to its customer. However, the designated banking establishment may use another banking establishment for collection.

### 2.7 – Opposition to Payment of a Check

Opposition to payment of a check is only admitted in case of loss, theft, fraudulent use or falsification of the check, receivership or judicial liquidation of the bearer.

The drawer must immediately confirm their opposition in writing regardless of the medium of this writing and support this opposition with any useful document.

### 2.8 - Recourse for Failure to Pay the Check: The Protest

The bearer may exercise their recourse against endorsers, the drawer and other obligors, if the check, presented in due time, is not paid and if the refusal of payment is established by protest.

The protest must be made before expiration of the presentation period. It must be made by the agents of the court registry office at the domicile of the one on whom the check was payable or at their last known domicile.

No act on the part of the check bearer can replace the act of protest, except in cases of loss or theft of the check.

The notification made to the drawer of the protest serves as a demand for payment.

The bearer of the protested check may request an ex parte order authorizing them to proceed with any conservatory seizure against the signatories of the check.

In default of payment upon expiration of a period of thirty days after seizure, the bearer of the check may proceed to sell the seized objects.

All persons obligated under a check are jointly liable to the bearer.

The bearer may claim from the one against whom they exercise their recourse:

- the amount of the unpaid check;
- interest from the day of presentation due at the legal rate for checks issued and payable in Morocco; this rate being increased by 1% for other checks;
- protest fees, those of notices given as well as other fees.

The one who has reimbursed the check may claim from their guarantors:

- the full amount they paid;
- interest on said amount from the day they disbursed it, calculated at the legal rate for checks issued and payable in Morocco, this rate being increased by 1% for other checks;
- the fees borne.

### 2.9 – Prescriptions

The bearer's actions for recourse against endorsers, the drawer and other obligors are prescribed by six months from the expiration of the presentation period.

The actions for recourse of the various obligors to payment of a check against each other are prescribed by six months from the day when the obligor reimbursed the check or from the day when they were themselves sued.

The action of the check bearer against the drawee is prescribed by one year from the expiration of the presentation period.

However, in case of forfeiture or prescription, there remains an action against the drawer who has not provided funds or other obligors who would have been unjustly enriched.

### 2.10 – General and Penal Provisions

- Between merchants and for commercial acts, any payment of a value exceeding ten thousand dirhams must be made by crossed check or by transfer.

Failure to observe these provisions is punishable by a fine whose amount cannot be less than 6% of the value paid.

The creditor and the debtor are jointly liable for payment of this fine.

- A fine of six percent of the check amount, with a minimum of 100 dirhams, is applicable in the following cases:
  - The drawer who issues a check not bearing indication of the place of issue or without date;
  - one who puts a false date on a check;
  - one who draws a check on a person other than a banking establishment.

The same fine is due personally and without recourse by the first endorser or bearer and by the one who pays or receives in compensation a check without indication of the place of issue or without date.

The drawer of a check who omits to maintain or constitute the check's provision for its payment on presentation is liable for the same fine.

- Any banking establishment that refuses payment of a check drawn on its coffers is required to issue to the bearer or their agent a certificate of refusal of payment.

- The drawee banking establishment that has refused payment of a check for lack of sufficient provision must enjoin the account holder to return to all banking establishments of which they are a client, the forms in their possession and that of their agents and to no longer issue, for a period of ten years, checks other than those that allow withdrawal of funds by the drawer from the drawee or those that are certified.

However, provided they do not incur a criminal prohibition, the account holder regains the ability to issue checks when they justify:

- that they have settled the amount of the unpaid check or have constituted sufficient and available provision for its settlement by the drawee;
- that they have paid the tax fine set as follows:
  - 5% of the amount of the unpaid check(s) subject to the first injunction;
  - 10% of the amount of the check(s) subject to the second injunction;
  - 20% of the amount of the check(s) subject to the third injunction and subsequent injunctions.

Is liable to imprisonment of one to five years and a fine of 2,000 to 10,000 dirhams without this fine being able to be less than 25% of the amount of the check or insufficient provision:

- the drawer of a check who omits to maintain or constitute the check's provision for its payment on presentation;
- the drawer of a check who irregularly prohibits the drawee from paying;
- any person who counterfeits or falsifies a check;
- any person who, knowingly, agrees to receive, endorse or guarantee a falsified or counterfeited check;
- any person who, knowingly, uses or attempts to use a counterfeited or falsified check;
- any person who, knowingly, agrees to receive or endorse a check on condition that it not be cashed immediately and that it be kept as a guarantee.

Counterfeited or falsified checks are confiscated and destroyed. The confiscation of materials, machines, apparatus or instruments that served or were intended to serve in the manufacture of said checks will be pronounced by court decision, except when they were used without the owner's knowledge.

- When the drawer of a check without provision has constituted or completed the provision within twenty days of presentation, the imprisonment sentence may be reduced or entirely suppressed, both for them and for all co-authors or accomplices.

- In addition, the court may pronounce against those convicted under the aforementioned offenses, the prohibition for a period of one to five years from issuing checks other than those that exclusively allow withdrawal of funds by the drawer from the drawee or those that are certified.

Is liable to imprisonment of one month to two years and a fine of 1,000 to 10,000 dirhams one who issues checks in contempt of the injunction addressed to them by the bank or in violation of the prohibition pronounced against them by justice.

# Chapter 4 – The Property Manager's Accounting

Accounting is a quantitative management technique that is useful and indispensable for any economic agent regardless of their size, activity and the domain in which they operate.

Maintaining accounting is a legal obligation for merchants.

As for the property manager, the legal framework for maintaining condominium accounting is set by Law 18-00 regulating the condominium of built buildings.

## 1 – General Notions on Accounting

### 1.1 - Definition and Role of Accounting

Accounting is a quantitative management technique that is useful and indispensable for any economic agent regardless of their size, activity and the domain in which they operate.

Maintaining accounting is first a legal obligation. Such is the case, for example, for merchants.

Article 1 of Dahir No. 1-92 of December 25, 1992 promulgating Law No. 9-88 relating to the accounting obligations of merchants, stipulates that "any natural or legal person having the quality of merchant within the meaning of the commercial code is required to keep accounting in the forms prescribed by this law."

Furthermore, Law No. 15-95 forming the commercial code stipulates in its Article 19 that "The merchant keeps accounting in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 9-88 relating to the accounting obligations of merchants promulgated by Dahir No. 1-92-138 of 30 Joumada II 1413 (December 25, 1992)" adding that "If it is regularly maintained, this accounting is admitted by the judge to serve as proof between merchants for commercial acts."

For its part, Article 18 of the same text stipulates that "Any merchant, for the needs of their commerce, has the obligation to open an account in a banking establishment or in a postal check center."

Finally, it is useful to recall the terms of Article 20 of the commercial code which stipulates that "Third parties may oppose to the merchant the content of their accounting even if irregularly maintained."

Professional condominium property managers are merchants and are therefore bound by these legal provisions in the management of their businesses.

For condominium management operations carried out by both professional and volunteer property managers (chosen from among the co-owners), the applicable accounting rules are those set by Law 18-00 and will be studied in the second paragraph of this chapter.

Accounting is also a management tool that allows business leaders as well as third parties (suppliers, customers, shareholders, banking and financial relations...) to know the situation of the business and assess its management.

### 1.2 – Maintaining Accounting

Maintaining accounting must satisfy the following rules:

- Keep accounting in national currency;
- Adopt the double-entry technique guaranteeing the arithmetic equality of debit and credit movements of accounts and the resulting balances;
- Rely on dated supporting documents, preserved, classified in a defined order, capable of serving as means of proof and bearing references to their recording in accounting;
- Respect chronological recording of operations;
- Maintain supporting books allowing establishment of end-of-period synthesis statements provided for by regulations in force;
- Allow reliable accounting control contributing to preventing errors and fraud and protecting assets;
- Control by inventory the existence and value of active and passive elements;
- Allow for each accounting record to know its origin, content, classification by nature, summary qualification as well as the reference of the supporting document that supports it.

### 1.3 - Accounting Media

The basic accounting media are as follows:

- **The journal book** maintained under conditions prescribed by law in which operations are recorded day by day and operation by operation;
- **The general ledger** formed by all individual and collective accounts that allows tracking of these accounts. Each account distinctly shows the balance at the beginning of the period, the cumulative debit and credit movements since the beginning of the period as well as its balance at the end of the period;
- **The trial balance** showing for each account the balance at the beginning of the period, the cumulative debit and credit movements since the beginning of the period, and the balance at the end of the period;
- **The inventory book** in which the balance sheet and profit and loss account of each period are transcribed.

### 1.4 - Recording Procedures – Principle of Double-Entry Accounting

Any accounting operation is translated by an entry affecting at least two accounts, one of which is credited and the other is debited.

When an operation is recorded, the totals of amounts entered as credit and debit must be strictly equal.

Entries are recorded in the journal in chronological order, and reported in the general ledger. The totals of movements in both documents must be equal.

The journal must be maintained without blanks or alterations of any kind.

Entries are made in the journal operation by operation and day by day. However, operations of the same nature carried out in the same place and during the same day may be grouped and recorded in the same entry.

Any error correction must leave the initial erroneous recording legible. Accounting must be organized such that corrections are made by negative number or by counter-entry. Accounting by negative amount is only admitted for error correction.

## 2 – Maintaining Accounting for the Co-owners' Syndicate

### 2.1 – Legal Framework for Maintaining Condominium Accounting

Article 24 of Law 18-00 stipulates that:

- The syndicate's accounts comprising the forecast budget, charges and income for the period, the cash flow situation, as well as annexes to the forecast budget are established in accordance with specific accounting rules set by regulatory means.
- The accounts are presented with comparison to the accounts of the previous approved period;
- The syndicate's charges and income, provided for in the accounting plan, are recorded as soon as they are committed by the syndicate regardless of their settlement or as soon as products are received by it. The commitment is settled by payment.

Article 26 of the same law specifies for its part, that among the missions assigned to the property manager are the following:

- to prepare the syndicate's budget project for examination and approval by the general assembly;
- to collect co-owners' contributions to charges against receipt;
- to issue a receipt to the co-owner in case of sale if they are not a debtor to the syndicate;
- to regularly establish the syndicate's budget and maintain accounting showing the cash flow situation of the syndicate and each co-owner;
- to communicate the syndicate's cash flow situation to co-owners, at least every three months;
- to maintain archives and registers relating to the building and syndicate and facilitate access to these documents for all co-owners, particularly before holding the general assembly whose agenda includes examination of the syndicate's accounting.

It is worth recalling in this regard the provisions of Article 32 of the same Law which stipulate that any co-owner has the right of access to archives, syndicate registers, particularly those relating to the cash flow situation.

### 2.2 – Nature of Accounting Operations Relating to the Co-owners' Syndicate

The co-owners' syndicate accounts consist of two categories:

- Accounts relating to condominium management and administration;
- Accounts relating to the syndicate's financial situation.

#### 2.2.1 – Accounts Relating to Condominium Management and Administration

Condominium management and administration requires:

- commitment of expenses called charges;
- collection of receipts called income.

##### 2.2.1.1 – Charges

Charges comprise all expenses made on behalf of condominium management. They include in particular:

- water and electricity consumption charges;
- personnel charges (concierge, gardener, cleaning lady, ...);
- allowances paid to the condominium property manager;
- maintenance and upkeep costs for common areas;
- syndicate administration charges;
- other fees and charges.

##### 2.2.1.2 – Income

Income comprises receipts generated by condominium management. They consist particularly of the following items:

- Co-owners' contribution to charges;
- Rental income;
- Financial income;
- Income generated by the use of common areas by third parties;
- other income.

#### 2.2.2 – Accounts of the Syndicate's Financial Situation

These accounts comprise:

- The syndicate's general accounts, composed of the cash situation, the bank account situation, as well as the situation of receivables and debts;
- Individual accounts of each co-owner representing their financial situation vis-à-vis the syndicate.

### 2.3 – Technical Aspects of Maintaining Accounting

#### 2.3.1 – Rules to Observe

Maintaining accounting must satisfy the following rules:

**Recording operations day by day on accounting media**

Operations must be recorded at the latest at the end of the day when they were carried out, on appropriate accounting media provided for this purpose, namely:

- The journal book;
- The general ledger;

**Adopt the double-entry accounting technique.**

This technique guarantees the arithmetic equality of debit and credit movements of accounts and the resulting balances.

Thus, accounting for an expense will be done as follows:

- on the debit side: the charge account concerned by the expense;
- on the credit side: the cash account moved for settlement of this expense.

# Chapter 5 – Management and Maintenance of Documents and Archives by the Property Manager

When one understands the importance of archives for a specific institution or organization, one can well understand that this concern should also be fundamental for the condominium property manager.

Indeed, as a fundamental link in condominium management, the property manager functions like a business. As such, it sends and receives a certain number of documents and correspondence whose management is its responsibility.

It is observed that many condominium property managers lose or destroy, through negligence or ignorance of their importance, documents that should be kept.

Furthermore, the documentation that the condominium property manager receives or issues often causes management difficulties.

The objectives of this chapter are to enable condominium property managers to:

- define what an archival document is
- understand the importance and function of archives
- establish and properly manage an efficient archival system

Based on these objectives, this chapter will comprise two parts:

- General principles of archive management
- Maintenance of condominium archives

## 1. General Principles of Archive Management

### 1.1. Function of Archives

#### 1.1.1. Definition

Archives consist of all documents produced by a company or organization related to the exercise of its professional activity.

Archiving means gathering, classifying and preserving these documents.

Any old document or one that has just been produced is in principle an archival document, for example:

- Regulatory and legislative texts governing condominiums
- Registers, various management books or inventories, various lists, files, etc.
- Correspondence or mail collection
- Contracts
- Accounting documents, etc.

#### 1.1.2. Importance of Archives

Archives are an invaluable source of information on the activity of a person, company or institution.

Considering the specific case of the condominium association, we would say that archives are a management tool, an activity planning tool, and a memory and conservation tool for matters dealt with and official texts.

Archives allow to:

- trace the origin and history of matters dealt with
- quickly provide requested information
- better manage the functioning of the condominium

Archives serve as proof to justify actions taken and decisions made. They have probative value.

#### 1.1.3. Different Types of Archives

Three types of archives are distinguished:

- **First-age archives or living archives:** also called administrative archives or current archives, these are documents less than five (05) years old and are frequently used.

- **Second-age archives or intermediate archives:** Documents 5 to 10 years old are classified in this category. They are rarely used and their reference is lesser.

- **Third-age archives or dead archives:** after a duration of 10 years, documents become dead archives or historical or definitive archives.

Furthermore, it is important to note that certain documents, works or legislative or regulatory texts may date back more than five years and nevertheless be classified in living archives due to their still current scope.

### 1.2. Archive Management

Managing, in the broadest sense, means implementing the means that allow achieving assigned objectives.

Managing also means planning ahead. To manage condominium archives, the property manager must therefore implement an efficient strategy allowing them to:

- evaluate the importance of documents to archive
- know how to sort them
- find a system for classifying and preserving these archives

#### 1.2.1. Creating Archives

To create archives in a condominium association, one must begin by studying and understanding its functioning.

This understanding involves studying the economic and regulatory framework governing condominiums.

This then allows creating a classification framework based on different management constraints.

Each condominium owners' association developing documents for executing its mission, these documents can be archived: this is the archival collection.

The archival collection is the set of documents arising from the activity of a person, company or organization.

Creating archives is based on intellectual processing carried out in several stages which are: sorting, classification, analysis and drafting of the inventory, conservation.

Sorting and classification are two operations that have a triple purpose:

- eliminate useless or expired documents
- know what one possesses
- be able to find it quickly

Furthermore, classification is developed taking into account the fundamental study of the real estate agency's functions.

#### 1.2.2. Sorting Archives

Sorting is a delicate operation that engages the responsibility of the real estate agency manager since it poses the problem of eliminations.

One must therefore "know how to destroy". Sorting is a selective operation that allows distributing documents into three categories:

- documents that have lost all value and can be deleted without delay
- documents presenting interest for the condominium association for a variable duration
- documents to be kept indefinitely

In retained files, only the original document will be kept.

Certain documents will be kept as specimens.

#### 1.2.3. Classifying Archives

Classification should not be confused with categorization.

Classification is material in nature, it is the physical filing operation.

Categorization is intellectual in nature, it is the determination of the filing theme.

Classification is the operation that results in filing documents according to a pre-established order that will be described precisely later. Documents are classified by origin by file.

The basic unit of classification is therefore the file, with the documents constituting it being the pieces (e.g., a letter, minutes, a register, etc.) that are filed inside the file.

In the case where one finds themselves with a significant number of isolated pieces, without an original file, one must create a "miscellaneous" file with a piece-by-piece inventory. This is a last resort solution that should be avoided as often as possible.

The qualities of good classification are:

- simplicity
- precision
- ease of use
- good conservation

File classification can be completed with sub-files. The file can thus be extended by as many sub-files as necessary without disturbing the classification. Sub-files thus classified and the number of pieces indicated are kept in folders or archival boxes.

#### 1.2.4. Document Analysis

This involves identifying each file and sub-file after a thorough analysis of document contents. This analysis consists of describing the file contents that will be written on its cover.

This summary can be done either directly on the file cover or on a label that will be glued to the cover, which will avoid crossings-out or overcharging and therefore allow better presentation.

The cover will thus contain the following information:

- the order number and file title
- the year
- sub-file titles

The file is therefore materially presented as a cardboard folder containing sub-files which can be sub-folders. Note that one can also write on sub-file covers the inventory of documents they contain.

In order to facilitate document searches by all potential users, it is recommended to create a classification directory.

The classification directory can be a simple school notebook. The manager will copy for each file the elements that compose it, i.e., the titles of its sub-files.

In this notebook, the manager will take care to reserve two facing pages to describe one single file. Indeed, an open file can, over the years, be expanded with new sub-files and it is important to maintain an overall view of all constitutive elements of the same file.

Thus, this notebook will allow anyone other than the manager to better understand the adopted archival system without having to handle and move all already classified documents.

#### 1.2.5. Archive Conservation

Archives being the company's memory and a management tool for the condominium association, the manager must ensure their protection and good conservation.

Certain archives having a confidential character, it is important to take all necessary measures to preserve this character.

Archival documents must be protected against rats, humidity which favors mold and fungi, termites, dust, fire.

Actions to undertake are: rat control and pest control of rooms, wall and roof waterproofing, regular cleaning and maintenance of premises and good ventilation.

The best document conservation is that done in metal cabinets or on metal shelving. This material is preferable to wood.

Archives can be stored in archival boxes or cardboard folders.

The cabinet and room where they are kept must be locked. Furthermore, the manager will ensure that no one eats or smokes in this room.

## 2. Maintenance of Condominium Archives

### 2.1. Legal Framework

#### 2.1.1. Property Manager's Responsibility Regarding Archive Maintenance

Among the tasks incumbent upon the property manager, as enumerated by Article 26 of Law 18-00 regulating condominiums, is the maintenance of archives and registers relating to the building and the association by facilitating all co-owners' access to these documents, particularly before holding the general assembly whose agenda includes examination of the association's accounting.

#### 2.1.2. Property Manager's Obligations Regarding Document Handover to the Newly Elected Property Manager

It follows from Article 28 of Law 18-00 that upon expiration of their mission, the property manager or their deputy is required, within a maximum period of 15 days from the appointment of the new property manager, to hand over to them all documents, archives, association and building registers, the treasury situation and all association assets including cash.

After expiration of this period and without the handover being completed, the new property manager may ask the president of the first instance court ruling in summary proceedings to order the former property manager to comply under penalty.

# Chapter 6 – Organization and Conduct of General Assemblies

## 1. Technical Aspects of General Assembly Proceedings

### 1.1. Attendance Sheet

The attendance sheet is a document of fundamental character. It is presented to members present at the general assembly meeting to record their names, the shares they hold, and their signatures.

The attendance sheet takes the form of a table with the following columns:

- Names of present members
- Their capacity (co-owner or name of co-owner they represent)
- References and address of the lot they own within the building
- Their personal address in case it differs from the aforementioned address
- Number of votes conferred by their shares in the condominium
- Their signature

The attendance sheet forms an integral part of the meeting minutes.

### 1.2. Meeting Chairmanship

The meeting chairman plays an essential role in the general assembly proceedings. To this end, they are responsible for:

- ensuring order in the meeting
- giving and withdrawing speaking rights from participants
- ensuring proper conduct of deliberations and votes

### 1.3. Agenda

The agenda should not be overloaded with detailed questions. It should be accompanied by all necessary documents presented in a readable, concise and correctly duplicated form.

The agenda should also be accompanied by draft resolutions for all listed questions giving rise to voting, so that co-owners have a clear idea in advance of what they will be asked to vote on.

### 1.4. Meeting Room

The meeting room should bring together as much as possible the minimum comfort conditions required for such circumstances.

It is advisable to use sound systems as soon as there are more than 30 people. This will have the advantage of forcing participants to speak in turn.

### 1.5. Debate Animation

To ensure meeting success, the chairman must energetically animate debates by strictly following the agenda.

It must be constantly recalled that an assembly is made to vote on pre-established resolutions.

### 1.6. Voting Operations

Draft resolutions put to vote must be well written, as close as possible to those previously distributed with the agenda.

Voting operations must take place with transparency and clarity.

## 2. Minutes

### 2.1. Role of Minutes

#### 2.1.1. Minutes: An Effective Means to Reconstruct Facts

Written recording allows restoring 100% of facts.

#### 2.1.2. Minutes: A Legal Document

Minutes are a very important legal document that allows recording all decisions made by co-owners within their general assembly framework, and makes them enforceable.

The non-existence of this document renders these decisions null and void.

### 2.2. Minutes Characteristics

To enable it to fulfill the roles described above, minutes must be characterized by:

- their exhaustiveness: they must address all subjects debated during the meeting
- their relevance: they must focus on essential subjects
- the speed of their establishment: their drafting must be completed within 48 hours after the meeting ends

### 2.3. Minutes Structure

Minutes must include the following elements:

#### 2.3.1. Description of Meeting Conditions

- Ordinary or extraordinary meeting
- Date, time and place of meeting
- Agenda as presented in convocation addressed to co-owners
- Number of co-owners or their representatives present and percentage of shares (votes) they hold in the condominium
- List of absent co-owners and percentage of shares (votes) they hold
- Attendance sheet approved by meeting chairman
- Name of meeting chairman and secretary (reporter) and conditions of their designation

#### 2.3.2. Description of Debate Proceedings

Minutes must specify the following points:

- Nature of interventions (people who intervened, summary of their interventions)
- Decisions made and percentage of favorable votes
- Names of co-owners who voted against these decisions or abstained from voting and nature of their possible reservations

#### 2.3.3. Description of Meeting Closing Conditions

These include:

- Meeting closing time
- Summary of general conditions under which the meeting took place

#### 2.3.4. Minutes Signature

Minutes will be signed on one hand by the chairman and secretary (reporter) of the meeting to attest to the authenticity of the minutes, and on the other hand by the elected property manager as notification of the document.

### 2.4. Minutes Notification

To become enforceable and to allow execution of decisions made, minutes must be notified to all co-owners, both those who attended the meeting and those who were absent.

To this end, the property manager, after the meeting, is called upon to take the following measures:

- Posting of minutes inside the building, in the place reserved for posting
- Notification of a copy of the minutes by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt to all co-owners, or hand delivery against receipt

### 2.5. Minutes Recording

Minutes of successive general assembly meetings are recorded in a special register kept by the condominium property manager.

The co-owners' general assembly is responsible for managing the condominium building in accordance with the law and condominium regulations and makes decisions whose execution is entrusted to a property manager or, where appropriate, to the syndical council.

The general assembly holds its first meeting at the initiative of one or more co-owners. It proceeds, during its first meeting, to establish the condominium regulations if they are not already developed, or to amend them if necessary, and to elect the building management body.

The ordinary general assembly meets at least once a year.

Furthermore, an extraordinary general assembly may be held whenever necessary, to which all co-owners are convened.

Unless otherwise stipulated in the condominium regulations, the general assembly takes, by absolute majority of votes of co-owners present or represented, decisions and measures relating to the application of condominium regulations and, in general, those relating to condominium building management.

The general assembly must never force a co-owner to change the destination or conditions of use and enjoyment of their individual part.

# Chapter 7 – Maintenance of Condominium Property

Among the property manager's attributions provided by Law 18-00 on condominiums are those to:

- ensure proper use of common areas by ensuring their maintenance, guarding main building entrances and common equipment
- carry out urgent repairs even ex officio

To this end, the condominium property manager is called upon to have a minimum of technical knowledge to enable them to face these prerogatives.

This chapter covers some basic notions regarding electricity and maintenance of plumbing, sanitary and sewerage installations.

## 1. General Electrical Notions

### Preliminary - Safety Measures

Before any work on the electrical circuit, it is absolutely necessary to cut the electrical current from the circuit being worked on. In old installations, protections not allowing isolation of a specific circuit, it is then imperative to cut current at the circuit breaker.

### 1.1. Earth Circuit

#### 1.1.1. Earth Connection

In electrical installations, the earthing circuit is very important for the safety of house inhabitants and especially for children.

The earth circuit begins with contact with real earth. This contact is ensured by an earth stake. It is found in different lengths, the choice of length depends on the type of terrain where it is driven. For heavy terrain (clay) one can settle for a length of 1m20, but for terrain consisting of backfill, a greater length will be needed to increase contact surface. It is connected to the cutting strip by a bare copper wire with a 25 mm² section.

#### 1.1.2. Earth Distribution in the Dwelling

From the cutting strip, the distribution panel is reached by a green/yellow insulated wire of the same section as the external connection supply wires.

From the panel, a 2.5 mm² green/yellow wire is sent to all metallic masses.

The main equipotential connection also leaves from the panel. This is the line that connects water supply pipes.

All circuits leave from the subscriber panel. They all include an earth wire of the same section as the corresponding circuit.

### 1.2. Subscriber Panel

The subscriber panel or fuse panel serves to separate different circuits.

It consists of a plastic support on which protections consisting of circuit breakers or fuses are placed.

It is preferable to use circuit breakers, because if a problem occurs, one simply needs to raise the control lever to restore current, while one doesn't always have the right fuse at hand.

There is also a strip where all earth wires are connected. Circuit breakers are supplied thanks to contact combs and terminal blocks.

There are different types of circuit breakers and different amperages (power).

The differential circuit breaker limits current overloads and ensures people protection.

The simple circuit breaker only limits current overloads.

### 1.3. Electrical Installation

#### 1.3.1. Different Installation Circuits

**Specialized Lines**

These are lines that supply outlets where specific appliances are plugged. These circuits are continuous from the panel to points of use.

- 32 A circuit: for oven or electric stove
- 20 A circuit: for washing machine, dishwasher, and water heater

**Normal Lines**

These lines can supply several points and therefore be cut. They are grouped in junction boxes.

- 16 A circuit: for normal power outlets
- 10 A circuit: for lighting circuits
- 2 A circuit: for auxiliary circuits (doorbell, electric water heater control circuit protection, etc.)

#### 1.3.2. Some Rules to Follow

In electrical installation, there are 2 colors to respect: BLUE which is only used for NEUTRAL, and GREEN/YELLOW which is reserved for the EARTH circuit.

In circuit breaker terminals, only two wires maximum can be placed.

Conductor section corresponds to copper wire surface. There are wire sections that correspond to well-defined usage powers.

- 1.5 mm²: lighting circuit, doorbell and everything that doesn't require great power
- 2.5 mm²: power outlet circuit, normal outlet, washing machine, dryer
- 6 mm²: electric stove circuit
- 10 mm²: supply up to 60 Amperes (12 KW)
- 16 mm²: supply up to 90 Amperes (18 KW)

### 1.4. Types of Electrical Installations

#### Simple Switching

Simple switching is the most common lighting installation.

#### Two-way Switching

Two-way switching allows turning on and off from 2 different locations (room with 2 doors, corridor).

#### Intermediate Switch

TWO-WAY SWITCHING can replace the impulse relay by inserting intermediate switches on the shuttle circuit. The number of intermediate switches depends on needs.

#### Impulse Relay

The impulse relay allows turning on and off from several different locations (used mainly in corridors or stairwells).

#### Power Outlet Circuits

In each circuit, we limit ourselves to 5 outlets. We go from outlet to outlet otherwise, we can make derivations in a box.

## 2. Problems with Plumbing and Sewerage Installations in Condominium Buildings

Water leaks and their consequences monopolize a good part of the energy of all those who deal with building management. Certainly, an important part comes from private sanitary installations, and for this aspect one will refer to problems relating to waterproofing and compliance of private sanitary installations. Problems related to old building networks are often endless and without solution, except to undertake heavy restructuring work and creation of new networks.

### 2.1. Water Supply Network Pathology

The following cases can be cited:

- **"Joint failure" due to overpressure:** this happens when the building is equipped with unsuitable or defective booster pumps, or when urban network pressure is excessive; in this case, pressure reducers should be installed

- **Corrosion due to metal assembly or contact with incompatible materials:** the responsibility of the company that carried out the installation is in this case engaged. It has the obligation to repair the defect and its consequences (damage)

- **Permanent humidity and condensation seepage causing external corrosion:** this is due to insufficient ventilation of premises through which pipes pass; either substantially improve ventilation or insulate the pipes

### 2.2. Wastewater and Rainwater Evacuation Network Pathology

These include:

- **Leaks at joints and assemblies:** this results from material aging and their degradation, from disconnections due to shocks, support unsealing or building or pipe movements

- **Scale buildup, notably in horizontal parts with low slope or at bends:** this is remedied by replacing deteriorated parts but also by modifying as much as possible the layout and fixing of pipes

- **Specific pathology of rainwater evacuation pipes:** calcites created by waters that have run off certain cements used for tile laying (accessible terrace coverings notably).

The cause must be sought by conducting analyses of cements on which waters passing through these pipes may have run off.

There is no known means of eliminating these calcites once they are deposited; to avoid continued deposits, the cause must be eliminated (if it involves tiled terraces, by replacing tiling with another type of covering and waterproofing).

Deposits can take such proportions that pipes can become completely blocked and need to be replaced from top to bottom.

### 2.3. Private Sanitary Installation Pathologies

Private sanitary installations are the nightmare of old buildings, notably those whose framework suffers greatly from infiltrations. Apartment owners in these buildings cannot imagine the liability risks they incur with non-compliant installations: in case of discovery of rotting of the building's load-bearing structures, and possibility of attributing this rotting to infiltrations from the apartment, they will be considered responsible for building damage and will have to bear - at worst alone, at best jointly with other owners - the cost of necessary repairs, which can amount to millions.

It doesn't matter if this rotting took decades to occur and if the owners have just acquired the housing: they will only have to turn against their predecessors. Generally, compliance is also required in case of housing rental.

### 2.4. Problems Related to Sewerage

The sewerage network consists of collectors gathering wastewater or rainwater at the foot of downspouts in buildings, and conducting them to connection(s) to the urban sewerage network in case of "all-to-sewer", or to the septic tank(s) in case the building or real estate complex is not yet connected.

Sewerage is the typical type of building equipment that recalls itself to good memory when one doesn't concern oneself with it from time to time.

Regular inspection and maintenance are necessary to avoid underground leaks that can have important environmental consequences and cause subsidence and sinkholes with incalculable consequences.

#### 2.4.1. Surveillance

The sewerage network is part of building components that must be subject to periodic diagnostics in order to detect deteriorations, pipe disconnections or crushing causing leaks, scale buildup likely to cause blockage, etc.

The optimal periodicity is ten years, but in certain contexts of particular fragility, this will be done every five years.

Let's recall that underground leaks are likely to cause soil and groundwater pollution, and constitute infractions to environmental protection regulations, and furthermore they cause underground disorders (subsidence, sinkholes etc.) likely to endanger building stability and circulation and roadway works.

#### 2.4.2. Maintenance

The preventive maintenance action par excellence is periodic cleaning (annual as much as possible) of collectors from chutes to connection to the public sewerage network.

Furthermore, for buildings not connected to a public sewerage network ("all-to-sewer"), tank inspection and maintenance must be carried out at least once every six months.

# THIRD PART

## THE SYNDIC IN ITS RELATIONS WITH CO-OWNERS, the concierge, maintenance staff AND THIRD PARTIES

# Chapter 1 – Relations of the syndic with co-owners

## 1 – Responsibility of the syndic

### 1.1 – Responsibility for the management of the syndicate

The syndic is responsible for its management before the co-owners' syndicate.

It is required in this context to provide all necessary explanations supported by supporting documents relating to its management acts.

Article 32 of Law 18-00 specifies in this regard that any co-owner has the right to access the archives and registers of the syndicate, particularly those relating to the treasury situation.

### 1.2 – Responsibility for the management of common areas

Article 13 of Law 18-00 regulating the co-ownership of built buildings stipulates that the co-owners' syndicate is held responsible for any damage due to negligence in the management and maintenance of common areas. It is also held responsible for building repairs and work carried out for its maintenance.

Furthermore, it appears from Article 26 of the same Law that among the missions assigned to the syndic, the latter is responsible in particular for:

- ensuring the proper use of common areas by ensuring their maintenance, guarding the main entrances of the building and common equipment;
- carrying out urgent repairs even ex officio.

It follows from the foregoing that the co-owners' syndicate represented by the syndic is responsible vis-à-vis co-owners and third parties for all damages resulting from negligence in the maintenance or poor management of common areas. This responsibility concerns both damages affecting common and private areas and those affecting third parties.

The syndicate may take action against the author of the damage.

Similarly, the co-owners' syndicate may take action against the person of the syndic if it appears that the negligence or poor management that caused the damage that is the subject of the dispute is attributable to the latter.

## 2 – Means of recourse for the syndic

### 2.1 – Means of recourse for the application of decisions taken by the general assembly of co-owners

Article 30 of Law 18-00 stipulates that within a maximum period of eight days following the date of decisions taken by the general assembly, the syndic or the syndic of the syndical council must notify all co-owners of the decisions accompanied by the minutes of meetings.

Notification is made either by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, or by a bailiff.

Any injured party may have recourse to the president of the first instance court of the building's location to contest the aforementioned decisions if they are contrary to legislative and regulatory texts in force. The appeal is decided in summary proceedings.

The syndicate and the syndic may, if necessary, ask the president of the first instance court to order the execution of the general assembly's decisions by having them accompanied by the executory formula.

### 2.2 – Means of recourse concerning the payment of charges

According to Article 25 of Law 18-00, in the absence of payment on its due date of a provision relating to participation in co-ownership charges, the other provisions provided for and not yet due become immediately payable after formal notice by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt that has remained unsuccessful for more than thirty days from the day after the first presentation of the registered letter to the recipient's domicile.

After having noted the vote of the provisional budget by the general assembly of co-owners as well as the forfeiture of the term, the president of the first instance court may order the payment of the payable provisions. The order is accompanied by provisional execution despite appeal.

Article 38 of Law 18-00 adds for its part that in case one of the co-owners does not pay the charges and expenses decided by the syndicate within a determined period, the president of the first instance court pronounces an order to pay in accordance with the aforementioned Article 25.

It should be noted in this regard that according to Article 40 of Law 18-00, the syndicate's claims against one of its members benefit from the forced mortgage provided for in Article 163 of the dahir of 19 Rajab 1933 (June 2, 1915) establishing the legislation applicable to registered real estate.

The mortgage is lifted and cancelled by order of the court president if he finds that the debtor co-owner has settled his debt and deposited it in the competent court treasury in favor of the mortgage creditor.

The one who constituted the mortgage can lift it.

For its part, Article 41 stipulates that the syndicate's claims benefit from a privilege on the furniture located in the apartment or premises and on the rental value in accordance with Article 1250 of the dahir of 9 Ramadan 1331 (August 12, 1913) forming the code of obligations and contracts.

### 2.3 – Means of recourse for payment of participation in charges in case of transfer of a private part

According to Article 42, in case of transfer of a divided part, the transferee is jointly responsible with the transferor towards the syndicate to guarantee payment of the syndicate's claims due by the transferor member.

The syndicate may bring an action for reimbursement of the payable claims against the transferee in accordance with the procedures provided for in the aforementioned Articles 25 and 38.

### 2.4 – Means of recourse for the execution of work in common areas

Article 33 stipulates that the co-owner, his beneficiaries or the occupant must not prohibit work relating to undivided parts decided by the general assembly even if they are carried out inside the divided parts.

The syndic is required to inform the co-owner or his beneficiaries or the occupant of the nature of the work eight days before it begins, unless it involves urgent work aimed at preserving the security of the co-ownership building and that of its occupants.

In case of refusal by one of the co-owners, the dispute may be brought before the summary judgment judge who may order the completion of the necessary work removing the damage.

Article 34 specifies for its part that the co-owner who has suffered damage as a result of the execution of the aforementioned work has the right to be compensated by the co-owners' syndicate. The latter has the right to take action against the author of the damage.

Article 35 stipulates furthermore that each co-owner has the right to take legal action to preserve his rights in the co-ownership building or repair the damage caused to the building or to common areas by one of the syndicate members or by a third party.

# Chapter 2 – Relations of the syndic with the concierge and maintenance staff

Relations with concierges and building maintenance staff are governed by:

- texts organizing concierge services and building maintenance;
- the Labor Code.

## 1 – 1977 texts organizing concierge services and building maintenance

Concierge services and building maintenance are governed by:

- Dahir bearing law no. 1-76-258 of 24 Shawwal 1397 (October 8, 1977) relating to building maintenance and the installation of concierge services in residential buildings;
- Decree no. 2-76-69 of 24 Shawwal 1397 (October 8, 1977) taken for the application of the dahir bearing law no. 1-76-258 of 24 Shawwal 1397 (October 8, 1977) relating to building maintenance and the installation of concierge services in residential buildings.

### 1.1 – Definition of the concierge

According to Article 3 of the aforementioned Dahir no. 1-76-258, any salaried person employed by the owner or, where applicable, by the person responsible for building management and housed in said building or in its courtyards and annexes, to ensure its surveillance and maintenance, is considered a concierge.

### 1.2 – Obligation to recruit a concierge and provide housing

Article 3 aforementioned stipulates that any building or group of residential buildings comprising at least ten apartments must include premises for concierge use either in the building or in its courtyards or annexes, and be provided with a concierge to ensure its guarding and maintenance.

The development of new premises for concierge use and the use of another concierge are mandatory whenever the number of apartments exceeds a multiple of ten.

However, Article 5 of the same Dahir specifies that buildings or groups of buildings in which the development of concierge facilities is technically impossible or would result in a reduction in the gross annual rent amount of more than 33% for the year following the publication date of the Dahir in question are exempt from the obligation provided for in Article 3.

The rental value of the premises taken into consideration is that determined by the urban tax service.

Regarding economic housing, Article 9 of the Dahir in question specified that any building or group of economic housing buildings comprising twenty to forty apartments, located within the scope of application of the Dahir in question, must include premises for concierge use either in the building or in its courtyards or annexes and be provided with a concierge to ensure its guarding and maintenance.

If the number of apartments in the building or group of buildings exceeds forty, the development of new premises for concierge use and the use of another concierge are mandatory.

The same applies whenever the number of apartments exceeds a multiple of forty.

Article 7 of the same Dahir specifies that the responsibility for hiring the concierge or maintenance staff falls to the owner or, where applicable, the building management manager.

### 1.3 – Conditions set for concierge housing

It appears from Article 6 of the aforementioned Dahir that concierge housing must meet the standards determined by current regulations regarding urban planning and housing and all other requirements set, where applicable, by decree.

Article 10 of the same Dahir stipulates that the useful surface area of premises for concierge use must not be less than:

- 30 m² for a composition of one room, kitchen and bathroom, in any building or group of buildings having no more than thirty apartments;
- 45 m² for a composition of two rooms, kitchen and bathroom, in any building or group of buildings having thirty-one to forty apartments.

For any additional bracket beyond forty and comprising either less than thirty apartments or thirty to forty apartments, the useful surface area of the premises must be that defined above for the corresponding number of apartments.

### 1.4 – Conditions for evicting the concierge's housing

According to Article 15 of Dahir 1-76-258 aforementioned, the concierge dismissed by the employer cannot be forced to leave his housing before a period of three months or without payment of compensation equal to the quarterly rental price of housing equivalent to that which he occupies.

In case of serious fault committed by the concierge in the exercise of his functions, his immediate dismissal as well as the eviction of the housing may be ordered, at the employer's request, by the summary judgment judge.

### 1.5 – Distribution of maintenance charges

According to Article 8 of the Dahir, notwithstanding all contrary legal or contractual provisions or any contrary usage, the amount of salaries and social charges resulting from the application of said dahir is borne one-third by the building owner and two-thirds by its occupants through incorporation into rental charges.

In co-ownership buildings, all salaries and charges resulting from the installation of concierge services and maintenance are distributed among co-owners in proportion to their rights.

### 1.6 – Maintenance work attributable to the concierge

In addition to surveillance, the concierge is also responsible for maintenance. Article 2 of the Application Decree of Dahir no. 1-76-258 stipulates that the maintenance of buildings subject to the application of said dahir must satisfy the following requirements:

- Wet cleaning of common passages including stairs, corridors, courtyards, halls, stairwells must be carried out daily. These places must be disinfected and, where applicable, pest control must be carried out;
- Stairwell windows must be washed at least once every two weeks;
- Necessary measures must be taken to avoid, in courtyards and on terraces, the formation of stagnant water collections from, in particular, rainwater, washing or watering water that could give rise to mosquito development. Similarly, measures must be taken to eliminate any cause of harmful emanations.
- Garbage chutes and, in particular, rooms reserved for household waste collection must be kept constantly clean. Garbage containers must be fitted with lids. After waste removal, these containers must be washed, disinfected or treated for insects daily.
- The obligation to clean and sweep extends to sidewalks facing the building.

Municipal authorities will take, within the framework of health regulations, orders determining complementary measures appropriate to ensure public hygiene and health.

### 1.7 – Status of concierges

#### 1.7.1 – Legal framework for concierge employment

Article 12 of Dahir no. 1-76-258 stipulates that the provisions of labor and social security legislation apply to concierges, subject to the provisions of Article 13 (housing).

Article 8 of the application decree specifies for its part that working conditions are freely discussed between the parties in accordance with current legislation. Their agreement must be recorded in a written contract, a copy of which is sent to the local authority.

#### 1.7.2 – Conditions for recruiting concierges

##### 1.7.2.1 – Priority persons for hiring concierges

It appears from Article 3 of the application decree of Dahir no. 1-76-258 that candidates with the status of former resistance fighter or former member of the liberation army as well as their beneficiaries benefit from priority for hiring in concierge and maintenance positions.

Are considered as beneficiaries of former resistance fighters and former members of the national liberation army, for the application of the aforementioned dahir bearing law:

- first-degree direct descendants, the surviving spouse and ascendants of the former resistance fighter or former member of the liberation army who died during the struggle for independence;
- first-degree direct descendants, the surviving spouse and ascendants of the former resistance fighter or former member of the liberation army who was disabled and deceased;
- first-degree direct descendants or the spouse of the former resistance fighter or former member of the liberation army who is disabled or unable to engage in any lucrative activity.

##### 1.7.2.2 – Declaration to local authority

According to Article 5 of the application decree, employers subject to the obligations provided for by dahir bearing law no. 1-76-258 are required to declare vacant positions to the local authority and to fill them as a priority with candidates presented by this authority in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of said decree.

Article 6 of the application decree specifies in this regard that job offers must be sent to the local authority within a period not exceeding fifteen days from the date of creation or vacancy of the position.

These offers must specify the nature of the job (concierge or maintenance), the salary offered, particular working conditions and the composition of the building and concierge lodge.

Article 7 of the application decree stipulates for its part that the local authority has a period of one month to communicate to the employer the names of candidates for the position.

In the absence of a response upon expiration of this period, the employer may hire any person of his choice or a specialized company without being bound by the provisions of Article 3.

Article 9 of the application decree adds that without prejudice, where applicable, to the prosecutions that may be initiated against the employer, any dismissal before the expiration of the current contract must be reported within forty-eight hours to the local authority which will propose, within the period provided for in Article 7, the names of other nationals, candidates for hiring.

#### 1.7.3 – Concierge salary

According to Article 13 of Dahir no. 1-76-258, the concierge's salary is freely set by agreement between the parties. Housing constitutes part of his remuneration.

Benefits in kind granted to concierges are taken into account for salary determination. Under no circumstances can they alone serve as salary. The part of the salary in kind, represented in particular by the rental value of the concierge premises, can under no circumstances exceed 33% of the concierge's gross salary.

The rental value taken into consideration is that determined by the urban tax service.

#### 1.7.4 – Concierge annual leave

Article 14 of Dahir no. 1-76-258 stipulates that the paid annual leave that concierges benefit from is subject to the provisions of Chapter XIV of the dahir of 5 Safar 1365 (January 9, 1946) relating to paid annual leave, as it has been modified and completed.

#### 1.7.5 – Sanctions

Articles 17 to 19 of Dahir no. 1-76-258 provided for the following sanctions against violators of the provisions of said Dahir:

- Anyone required to develop or build concierge housing who has not fulfilled these obligations within the deadlines provided for in Article 4 is punished by a fine of 500 to 2,000 Dh.
- Anyone required to hire a concierge or maintenance staff who commits one of the following infractions is punished by a fine of 2,000 to 5,000 Dh:
  - Failure to declare the vacant position within the prescribed deadlines;
  - Position vacancy for a period exceeding two months, except in cases of proven force majeure;
  - Hiring a person in violation of the provisions of the application decree provided for in Article 21.

The local authority, in the case referred to in paragraph 2, may fill the position ex officio at the expense of persons required to hire a concierge or maintenance staff.

Violations of the dahir provisions are noted, as the case may be, by judicial police officers as well as by labor inspectors and controllers and municipal personnel commissioned for this purpose.

## 2 – Labor Code provisions

It is recalled that according to Article 12 of Dahir no. 1-76-258, the provisions of labor and social security legislation apply to concierges.

Labor legislation is governed by law no. 65-99 relating to the Labor Code, promulgated by Dahir no. 1-03-194 of 14 Rajab 1424 (September 11, 2003), published in Official Bulletin no. 5210 of Thursday, May 6, 2004.

The following provisions concern concierges.

### 2.1 – The employment contract

#### 2.1.1 – Trial period

According to Article 13 of the Labor Code, the trial period is the period during which each party may voluntarily terminate the employment contract without notice or compensation.

However, after at least one week of work, termination of the trial period not motivated by the employee's serious fault can only take place by giving one of the following notice periods:

- two days before termination if paid daily, weekly or fortnightly;
- eight days before termination if paid monthly.

If, after expiration of the trial period, the employee is dismissed without having committed a serious fault, he must benefit from a notice period that cannot be less than eight days.

Article 14 of the Code set the duration of the trial period as follows:

**In case of indefinite-term employment contract:**

- Three months for executives and equivalent;
- One and a half months for employees;
- Fifteen days for workers.

The trial period may be renewed only once.

**In case of fixed-term employment contract, the trial period cannot exceed:**

- One day for each week of work within the limit of two weeks when dealing with contracts of less than six months duration;
- One month when dealing with contracts of more than six months duration.

Trial periods shorter than those mentioned above may be provided for by the employment contract, collective agreement or internal regulations.

#### 2.1.2 – Employment contract formality

According to Article 18 of the Code, proof of the existence of the employment contract may be provided by all means. The written employment contract is exempt from registration fees.

Article 15 of the Code specifies for its part that the validity of the employment contract is subject to conditions relating to the consent and capacity of the parties to contract as well as to the object and cause of the contract, as they are set by the code of obligations and contracts.

In case of written conclusion, the employment contract must be established in two copies bearing the signatures of the employee and employer legalized by the competent authority. The employee keeps one of the two copies.

On the other hand, Article 16 of the Code stipulates that the employment contract is concluded for an indefinite period, for a fixed period or to accomplish specific work.

The fixed-term employment contract may be concluded in cases where the employment relationship could not have an indefinite duration.

The fixed-term employment contract can only be concluded in the following cases:

- replacement of one employee by another in case of suspension of the latter's employment contract, except if the suspension results from a strike;
- temporary increase in company activity;
- if the work has a seasonal character.

The fixed-term employment contract may be concluded in certain sectors and in certain exceptional cases set by regulatory means after consultation with the most representative professional employers' organizations and trade union organizations of employees or by virtue of a collective labor agreement.

It is also worth noting the provisions of Article 17 specifying that upon the opening of a company for the first time or a new establishment within the company or upon the launch of a new product for the first time, in sectors other than the agricultural sector, a fixed-term employment contract may be concluded for a maximum period of one year renewable only once. After this period, the contract becomes indefinite-term in all cases.

### 2.2 – Employee obligations

According to Article 20 of the Code, the employee is responsible within the framework of his work for his act, negligence, incompetence or imprudence.

For its part, Article 21 of the Code stipulates that the employee is subject to the employer's authority within the framework of legislative or regulatory provisions, the employment contract, collective labor agreement or internal regulations.

The employee is also subject to the provisions of texts regulating professional ethics.

Article 22 of the Code stipulates for its part that the employee must ensure the conservation of things and means that have been given to him for the accomplishment of the work with which he has been charged; he must return them at the end of his work.

He is responsible for the loss or deterioration of the aforementioned things and means if it appears to the judge, by the discretionary power he has, that this loss or deterioration is attributable to the employee's fault, particularly by using said things and means outside their intended purpose or outside working hours.

The employee is not responsible for deterioration and loss resulting from fortuitous circumstances or force majeure.

### 2.3 – Employer obligations

According to Article 24 of the Code, in general, the employer is required to take all necessary measures to preserve the safety, health and dignity of employees in accomplishing the tasks they perform under his direction and to ensure the maintenance of rules of good conduct, good morals and good morality in his company.

### 2.4 – Normal working hours

According to Article 184 of the Code, the normal working time for employees is set at 2288 hours per year or 44 hours per week.

The overall annual working time may be distributed over the year according to company needs provided that normal working time does not exceed ten hours per day, subject to certain exceptions referred to in Articles 189, 190 and 192.

### 2.5 – Leave and absence authorizations

#### 2.5.1 – Weekly rest

Article 205 of the Code stipulates that employees must be granted mandatory weekly rest of at least twenty-four hours from midnight to midnight.

Article 206 specifies that weekly rest must be granted either on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or the weekly market day.

#### 2.5.2 – Rest on paid holidays and public holidays

It appears from Article 217 of the Code that it is forbidden for employers to employ employees during paid holidays, the list of which is determined by regulatory means, and during public holidays.

#### 2.5.3 – Paid annual leave

According to Article 231 of the Code, except for more favorable provisions in the employment contract, collective labor agreement, internal regulations or customs, any employee has the right, after six months of continuous service in the same company or with the same employer, to paid annual leave whose duration is set as follows:

- one and a half days of actual work per month of service;
- two days of actual work per month of service for employees under eighteen years old.

Article 232 adds that the duration of paid annual leave is increased by one and a half days of actual work for each complete period, continuous or not, of five years of service, without however this increase being able to bring the total duration of leave to more than thirty days of actual work.

It should be noted in this regard that Article 263 prohibits any employee benefiting from paid annual leave from performing paid work during his leave.

#### 2.5.4 – Absence due to illness

According to Article 271, any employee who cannot come to work due to illness or accident must justify it and notify the employer within the following forty-eight hours, except in cases of force majeure.

If the absence extends more than four days, the employee must inform the employer of the probable duration of his absence and provide him, except in case of impediment, with a medical certificate justifying his absence.

The employer may have a counter-examination of the employee performed by a doctor of his choice and at his expense during the duration of absence fixed by the medical certificate produced by the employee.

Article 272 specifies for its part that when absence due to illness or accident, other than occupational illness or work accident, exceeds one hundred and eighty consecutive days during a period of three hundred and sixty-five days, or when the employee has become unable to continue exercising his work, the employer may consider him as having resigned from his job.

Article 273 specifies for its part that except for contrary provision in the employment contract, collective labor agreement or internal regulations, absences due to illness or accident, other than occupational illness or work accident, are not remunerated, regardless of pay periodicity.

#### 2.5.5 – Maternity leave

Article 152 of the Code stipulates that the female employee in a state of pregnancy attested by medical certificate has maternity leave of fourteen weeks, except for more favorable stipulations in the employment contract, collective labor agreement or internal regulations.

Article 153 adds in this regard that female employees in childbirth cannot be employed during the period of seven consecutive weeks following childbirth.

The employer ensures to lighten the work entrusted to the female employee during the period that precedes and that which immediately follows childbirth.

#### 2.5.6 – Special absence permits

- **Birth:** 3 paid days (art. 269);
- **Employee marriage:** 4 days including 2 paid days (art. 274 and 276);
- **Marriage of an employee's child or a child from a previous marriage of the employee's spouse:** 2 unpaid days (art. 274);
- **Death of a spouse, child, grandchild, ascendant of the employee or child from a previous marriage of the employee's spouse:** 3 days including one payable day for the death of the spouse, father, mother or child of the employee (art. 274 and 276);
- **Death of a brother, sister of the employee, brother or sister of the employee's spouse or ascendant of the spouse:** 2 unpaid days (art. 274);
- **Circumcision:** two unpaid days (art. 274);
- **Surgical operation of spouse or dependent child:** two unpaid days (art. 274).

### 2.6 – Suspension and termination of employment contract

#### 2.6.1 – Provisional suspension

Article 32 of the Labor Code sets the cases in which the employment contract may be provisionally suspended. However, notwithstanding expressly provided cases, the fixed-term employment contract ends on its expiration date.

#### 2.6.2 – Voluntary termination of employment contract

##### 2.6.2.1 – Termination by the employee

According to Article 34 of the Code, the indefinite-term employment contract may cease by the employee's will by means of resignation bearing the signature legalized by the competent authority. The employee is only bound in this regard by provisions relating to notice period.

On the other hand, Article 42 stipulates that when an employee, having abusively terminated his employment contract, engages his services again, the new employer is jointly responsible for the damage caused to the previous employer in the following cases:

- when it is established that he intervened so that the employee left his job;
- when he hired an employee he knew was already bound by an employment contract;
- when he continued to employ an employee after learning that this employee was still bound to another employer by an employment contract.

In this last case, the new employer's responsibility ceases to exist if, at the moment he was warned, the employment contract abusively terminated by the employee had come to expiration by the arrival of the term for a fixed-term contract or by expiration of the notice period for an indefinite-term contract.

##### 2.6.2.2 – Termination by the employer

Article 34 stipulates that the indefinite-term employment contract may cease by the employer's will, subject to the following provisions:

- Respect for legal provisions relating to notice period. It should be noted in this regard that Article 43 considers as null, in all cases, any clause setting the notice period at less than eight days.
- It is forbidden to dismiss an employee without valid reason except if this is linked to his aptitude or conduct within the framework of provisions provided for in the last paragraph of Article 37 (disciplinary sanctions) and Article 39 (serious fault) or based on the operating needs of the company within the framework of provisions of Articles 66 and 67 (dismissal for technological, structural or economic reasons).

#### 2.6.3 – Abusive dismissal

According to Article 36, the following do not constitute valid reasons for taking disciplinary sanctions or dismissal:

- union affiliation or exercise of a union representative mandate;
- participation in union activities outside working hours or, with the employer's consent or in accordance with the collective labor agreement or internal regulations, during working hours;
- the fact of being a candidate for a delegates' mandate, exercising it or having exercised it;
- the fact of having filed a complaint or participated in judicial actions against the employer within the framework of provisions of this law;
- race, color, sex, marital status, family responsibilities, religion, political opinion, national ancestry or social origin;
- disability insofar as it does not prevent the disabled employee from exercising an adequate function within the company.

Article 40 specifies for its part that the following are considered as serious faults committed by the employer, head of company or establishment against the employee:

- serious insult;
- practice of any form of violence or aggression directed against the employee;
- sexual harassment;
- incitement to debauchery.

The fact for the employee to leave his work due to one of the aforementioned faults is assimilated to abusive dismissal, when it is established that the employer committed one of these faults.

For its part, Article 41 stipulates that in case of abusive termination of the employment contract by one of the parties, the injured party has the right to demand damages.

The parties cannot renounce in advance the eventual right to demand damages resulting from contract termination whether it is abusive or not.

The employee dismissed for a reason he judges abusive may have recourse to preliminary conciliation procedure to reintegrate his position or obtain damages.

In case of damages payment, the receipt for delivery of the amount is signed by the employee and employer or his representative, the signatures duly legalized by the competent authority. It is also countersigned by the agent responsible for labor inspection.

The agreement obtained within the framework of preliminary conciliation is deemed final and not subject to recourse before the courts.

In the absence of an agreement reached through preliminary conciliation, the employee has the right to seize the competent court which may rule, in the case of abusive dismissal of the employee, either by reintegration of the employee in his position or by damages whose amount is set based on one and a half months' salary per year or fraction of year of work without however exceeding the ceiling of 36 months.

#### 2.6.4 – Dismissal for non-serious faults

According to Article 37, the employer may take one of the following disciplinary sanctions against the employee for non-serious fault:

- warning;
- reprimand;
- a second reprimand or suspension for a duration not exceeding eight days;
- a third reprimand or transfer to another service or, where applicable, to another establishment, the employee's place of residence being taken into consideration.

Article 38 adds that the employer applies disciplinary sanctions gradually. When disciplinary sanctions are exhausted within the year, the employer may proceed with the employee's dismissal. In this case, the dismissal is considered justified.

Article 62 specifies in this regard that before dismissing the employee, he must be able to defend himself and be heard by the employer or his representative in the presence of the employee delegate or union representative in the company that he chooses himself within a period not exceeding eight days from the date of finding of the act imputed to him.

A report is drawn up in this regard by the company administration, signed by both parties, a copy of which is delivered to the employee.

If one of the parties refuses to undertake or continue the procedure, recourse is made to the labor inspector.

Article 52 stipulates furthermore that the employee bound by an indefinite-term employment contract has the right to compensation in case of dismissal after six months of work in the same company regardless of the remuneration method and pay periodicity.

The amount of this compensation was set by Article 53 as follows, for each year or fraction of year of actual work:

- 96 hours of salary for the first five years of seniority;
- 144 hours of salary for the seniority period from 6 to 10 years;
- 192 hours of salary for the seniority period from 11 to 15 years;
- 240 hours of salary for the seniority period exceeding 15 years.

#### 2.6.5 – Dismissal for serious fault

According to Article 39 of the Code, the following are considered as serious faults that may cause employee dismissal:

- crime affecting honor, trust or good morals having given rise to a final judgment depriving of liberty;
- disclosure of professional secret having caused damage to the company;
- the fact of committing the following acts inside the establishment or during work:
  - theft;
  - breach of trust;
  - public drunkenness;
  - consumption of narcotics;
  - physical assault;
  - serious insult;
  - deliberate and unjustified refusal of the employee to perform work within his competence;
  - unjustified absence of the employee for more than four days or eight half-days during a period of twelve months;
  - serious deterioration of equipment, machines or raw materials caused deliberately by the employee or following serious negligence on his part;
  - employee's fault causing considerable material damage to the employer;
  - non-observance by the employee of instructions to follow to guarantee work or establishment safety having caused considerable damage;
  - incitement to debauchery;
  - any form of violence or aggression directed against an employee, employer or his representative affecting the operation of the company.

In this case, the labor inspector notes the damage to the establishment's operation and draws up a report.

Article 61 specified in this regard that in case of serious fault, the employee may be dismissed without notice or compensation or payment of damages.

For its part, Article 65 stipulates that under penalty of forfeiture, the legal action concerning dismissal must be brought before the competent court within a period of 90 days from the date of receipt by the employee of the dismissal decision.

# Chapter 3 – Relations of the syndic with third parties

Relations with third parties are governed by the Dahir forming the code of obligations and contracts of August 12, 1913.

The study of these relations will be done from two angles:

- Conditions for validity of contractual obligations
- Obligations relating to responsibility for acts and words

## 1 – Conditions for validity of contractual obligations

Any contract subscribed by parties without any intervention of a public officer is called a private act or contract.

By contrast, an authentic act is drafted by a notary or adoul as the case may be, who keep the acts in their archives.

Article 2 of the DOC specifies that "The elements necessary for the validity of obligations that derive from a declaration of will are:

- The capacity to bind oneself;
- A valid declaration of will concerning the essential elements of the obligation;
- A certain object that can form the object of obligation;
- A lawful cause to bind oneself".

### 1.1 - Capacity

According to Article 3 of the DOC, the individual's civil capacity is regulated by the law that governs his personal status.

The same article adds that any person is capable of binding and being bound, if he is not declared incapable by this law.

The personal status of Muslims is governed by Law no. 70.03 bearing the Family Code promulgated by Dahir no. 1-04-22 of February 3, 2004.

Article 2 of the Family Code stipulates that the provisions of this Code apply to:

- All Moroccans, even those bearing another nationality;
- Refugees, including stateless persons, in accordance with the Geneva Convention of July 28, 1951, relating to the status of refugees;
- Couples where one of the spouses is Moroccan;
- The relationship between two Moroccan persons, one of whom is Muslim.

The personal status of Moroccan Israelites remains determined by Hebrew religious rules.

The personal status of foreigners is determined by their national law, in accordance with the dahir of August 12, 1913 on the civil condition of French and foreigners.

#### 1.1.1 – Definition of capacity

According to Article 206 of the Family Code, there are two types of capacities: legal capacity and capacity to act.

Legal capacity is defined as the faculty that a person has to acquire rights and assume duties as fixed by law. This capacity is attached to the person throughout his life and cannot be taken away from him.

Capacity to act is the faculty that a person has to exercise his personal and patrimonial rights and which makes his acts valid.

The law fixes the conditions for acquiring capacity to act, the reasons determining the limitation of this capacity or its loss.

#### 1.1.2 – Legal majority

According to Article 209 of the Family Code, the age of legal majority is set at 18 years completed.

#### 1.1.3 – Legal representation of incapable persons

According to Article 230 of the Family Code, legal representative means:

- the legal guardian, who is the father, mother and judge, in case of absence of both parents;
- the testamentary guardian, who is designated by the father or mother;
- the dative guardian, who is appointed by the court.

Article 231 specifies for its part that legal representation is ensured by:

- the major father,
- the major mother, in case of death of the father or his incapacity;
- the testamentary guardian designated by the father;
- the testamentary guardian designated by the mother;
- the judge;
- the dative guardian.

Article 238 adds that the mother may ensure guardianship of her children provided:

- that she is of age;
- that the father is deceased, absent, incapable of ensuring guardianship or any other reason.

If the deceased father has designated a testamentary guardian with the mother, the testamentary guardian's prerogatives are limited to supervising the mother's management of the ward's affairs, with recourse to justice where applicable.

The mother may designate a testamentary guardian to her ward son. She may revoke this testamentary guardianship. Testamentary guardianship is submitted to the judge for approval upon the mother's death.

#### 1.1.4 – Limits of guardian's prerogatives

The following management acts can only be exercised by the testamentary or dative guardian after obtaining authorization from the judge responsible for minors' affairs:

- sell property of the incapable person of a value exceeding ten thousand dirhams, or create a real right on these properties,
- develop part of the incapable person's property in a company or business, or invest it in a transaction or in auctions;
- renounce a right of the incapable person or withdraw from an action or transact or compromise in such areas;
- lease the minor's real estate for a duration that may exceed the date of his majority;
- accept or refuse gifts made under condition;
- reimburse debts that have not been the subject of an executory judgment;
- serve, on the incapable person's property, the pension due to him except executory judgment.

The judge's decision to allow one of these acts must be justified.

#### 1.1.5 – End of guardianship

According to Article 218 of the Family Code, guardianship ends once the minor reaches the age of majority, unless guardianship is due to other reasons among those that justify it.

When the minor reaches the age of 16, he may ask the court to grant him majority.

For his part, the legal representative may ask the court to grant majority to the minor who has reached the aforementioned age, if he perceives in him signs of majority.

Granting majority implies that the beneficiary receives his property and obtains full capacity to manage and dispose of it. Rights other than financial remain governed by the legal texts relating to them.

In all cases, majority can only be granted when it is duly established by the court after the necessary legal measures have been taken.

On the other hand, it is the right of the person under guardianship due to mental disability or prodigality to ask the court to lift guardianship if he perceives in himself signs of maturity. This same right belongs to the legal guardian.

### 1.2 - Declaration of will

According to Article 19 of the DOC, the agreement is only perfect by the agreement of the parties on the essential elements of the obligation, as well as on all other lawful clauses that the parties consider as essential.

Furthermore, Article 33 of the DOC stipulates that no one can bind another, nor stipulate for him, if he does not have the power to represent him by virtue of a mandate or the law.

It is useful to recall in this regard that according to Article 38 of the DOC, consent or ratification may result from silence, when the party whose rights are being disposed of is present, or is duly informed of it, and does not contradict it without any legitimate reason justifying his silence.

Article 39 furthermore specifies that "consent given by error, surprised by fraud, or extorted by violence is voidable".

### 1.3 - Object of contracts

Article 57 of the DOC stipulates that "things, facts and incorporeal rights that are in commerce can alone form the object of obligation". The same article adds that "all things about which the law does not expressly forbid contracting are in commerce".

### 1.4 - Cause of contracts

Article 62 of the DOC stipulates that "obligation without cause or based on an unlawful cause is null and void".

## 2 – Obligations resulting from responsibility for acts and words

### 2.1 – Unjust enrichment

According to Article 66 of the DOC, one who has received or finds himself possessing a thing or other value belonging to another, without a cause that justifies this enrichment, is required to restore it to the one at whose expense he has enriched himself.

Similarly, Article 67 stipulates that one who, in good faith, has derived profit from another's work or thing, without a cause that justifies this profit, is required to compensate the one at whose expense he has enriched himself to the extent that he has profited from his act or his thing.

Article 75 adds that one who has unduly enriched himself to the detriment of another is required to restore identically what he has received, if it still exists, or its value on the day he received it, if it has perished or been deteriorated by his act or fault; he is even liable for loss or deterioration by fortuitous case, from the moment the thing reached him, if he received it in bad faith.

The holder in bad faith must, moreover, restore the fruits, increases and benefits he has received from the day of payment or undue reception, and those he should have received if he had administered well. He is only liable up to the amount by which he has profited, and from the day of demand if he was in good faith.

Furthermore, Article 76 specifies that if the one who received in good faith has sold the thing, he is only required to restore the sale price or to assign the actions he has against the buyer, if he was still in good faith at the time of sale.

### 2.2 – Payment of a debt by error

Article 68 of the DOC stipulates that one who, believing himself a debtor, by an error of law or fact, has paid what he did not owe, has the right of repetition (restitution) against the one to whom he paid. But the latter owes no restitution if, in good faith and as a consequence of this payment, he has destroyed or cancelled the title, deprived himself of the guarantees of his claim, or let his action prescribe against the true debtor. In this case, the one who paid has recourse only against the true debtor.

Furthermore, according to Article 69, there is no place for repetition when one has voluntarily settled and in full knowledge of the facts what one knew one was not required to pay.

### 2.3 – Responsibility for damages caused to others

#### 2.3.1 – Personal responsibility

According to Article 77, any act whatsoever of man which, without the authority of law, knowingly and voluntarily causes material or moral damage to another, obliges its author to repair said damage, when it is established that this act is the direct cause of it. Any contrary stipulation is without effect.

Article 78 adds that each person is responsible for moral or material damage he has caused, not only by his act, but by his fault, when it is established that this fault is the direct cause of it. Any contrary stipulation is without effect.

Fault consists either in omitting what one was required to do, or in doing what one was required to refrain from, without intention to cause damage.

#### 2.3.2 – Responsibility for the acts of persons

According to Article 85, one is responsible not only for damage that one causes by one's own act, but also for that which is caused by the act of persons for whom one must answer.

- The father and mother after the husband's death are responsible for damage caused by their minor children living with them;
- Masters and principals, for damage caused by their servants and agents in the functions for which they have employed them;
- Artisans, for damage caused by their apprentices during the time they are under their supervision;

The above responsibility takes place unless fathers and mothers and artisans prove that they could not prevent the act that gives rise to this responsibility.

The father, mother, other relatives or spouses are responsible for damages caused by the insane and other mentally infirm persons, even of age living with them, if they do not prove:

- That they exercised all necessary supervision over these persons;
- Or that they were unaware of the dangerous character of the insane person's illness;
- Or that the accident occurred through the fault of the one who was its victim.

The same rule applies to those who take charge, by contract, of the maintenance or supervision of these persons.

#### 2.3.3 – Responsibility for animal acts

According to Article 86, each person must answer for damage caused by the animal he has in his care, even if it has strayed or escaped, if he does not prove:

- That he took the necessary precautions to prevent it from causing harm or to supervise it;
- Or that the accident comes from a fortuitous case or force majeure, or from the fault of the one who was its victim.

#### 2.3.4 – Responsibility for things

According to Article 88, each person must answer for damage caused by things he has in his care, when it is justified that these things are the direct cause of the damage, if he does not demonstrate:

- That he did everything necessary to prevent the damage;
- And that the damage depends either on a fortuitous case, or on force majeure, or on the fault of the one who is its victim.

Article 89 adds that the owner of a building or other construction is responsible for damage caused by its collapse or partial ruin, when one or the other occurred as a result of age, lack of maintenance, or construction defect. The same rule applies to the case of fall or partial ruin of what is part of a building such as trees, machines incorporated into the building and other accessories deemed real estate by destination.

This responsibility weighs on the owner of the surface, when ownership of it is separate from that of the soil. When another than the owner is required to provide for the building's maintenance, either by virtue of a contract, or by virtue of usufruct or other real right, it is this person who is responsible.

When there is dispute over ownership, responsibility falls on the current possessor.

Furthermore, Article 90 stipulates that the owner of real estate who has just reasons to fear the collapse or partial ruin of a neighboring building may require from the building's owner, or from the one who would be required to answer for it, under the terms of Article 89, that he take the necessary measures to prevent the ruin.

It is worth noting on the other hand the stipulations of Article 91 which specify that neighbors have action against owners of unhealthy or inconvenient establishments to demand either the suppression of these establishments or the adoption of necessary changes to make the inconveniences they complain of disappear; authorization from competent authorities could not prevent the exercise of this action.

Article 92 specifies that however, neighbors are not entitled to claim the suppression of damages that derive from ordinary neighborhood obligations, such as smoke that escapes from chimneys and other inconveniences that cannot be avoided and do not exceed the ordinary measure.

#### 2.3.5 – Responsibility of the State and municipalities

According to Article 79, the State and municipalities are responsible for damages caused directly by the operation of their administrations and by service faults of their agents.

Article 80 adds that State and municipal agents are personally responsible for damages caused by their fraud or by serious faults in the exercise of their functions.

The State and municipalities can only be prosecuted for these damages in case of insolvency of the responsible officials.

#### 2.3.6 – Cases of exemption from responsibility

According to Article 94, there is no ground for civil responsibility when a person, without intention to harm, has done what he had the right to do.

However, when the exercise of this right is likely to cause notable damage to another and this damage can be avoided or suppressed without serious inconvenience for the rights holder, there is ground for civil responsibility if one has not done what was necessary to prevent it or to make it cease.

Article 95 adds that there is no ground for civil responsibility in the case of legitimate defense, or when damage has been produced by a purely fortuitous cause or force majeure, which has been neither preceded nor accompanied by an act imputable to the defendant.

### 2.4 – Responsibility for information and intelligence provided

According to Article 82, one who, in good faith, and without there being serious fault or grave imprudence on his part, gives information whose falseness he is unaware of, is not liable for any responsibility towards the person who is the object of this information:

- When there was for him or for the one who received the information a legitimate interest in obtaining it;
- When he was required, as a result of his business relations or a legal obligation, to communicate the information that was within his knowledge.

Article 83 adds for its part that simple advice or recommendation does not engage the responsibility of its author, except in the following cases:

- If he gave this advice with the aim of deceiving the other party;
- When having intervened in the matter by reason of his functions, he committed a serious fault, that is to say a fault that a person in his position should not have committed, and damage resulted for the other;
- When he guaranteed the results of the matter.

### 2.5 – Unfair competition

According to Article 84, the following facts constituting unfair competition may give rise to damages, for example:

- The fact of using a name or mark almost similar to those legally belonging to a house or factory already known, or to a locality having a collective reputation, in a manner to induce the public into error about the manufacturer's individuality and the product's provenance;
- The fact of using a sign, painting, inscription, placard, or any other emblem whatsoever, identical or similar to those already legally adopted by a merchant, manufacturer, or establishment of the same place, doing business in similar products, in a manner to divert clientele from one to the profit of the other;
- The fact of adding to a product's name the words: "in the style of", "according to the recipe of" or other analogous expressions, tending to induce the public into error about the product's nature or origin;
- The fact of making people believe, by publications or other means, that one is the assignee or representative of another house or establishment already known.
