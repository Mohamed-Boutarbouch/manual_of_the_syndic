# FIRST PART

## CONDOMINIUM: DEFINITION, LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES

# Chapter 1 – Condominium in Moroccan law: Condominium legislation

Condominium management requires the establishment of an appropriate legal framework and structures designed to perpetuate this real estate heritage and to encourage real estate developers to invest in it.

To this end, **law 18-00** relating to the status of condominium of built buildings which came into force on **November 7, 2003** provided the framework and legal tools to achieve these objectives, by precisely defining the components of condominium as well as the rights and obligations of co-owners, and by providing this institution with adequate bodies, of which the syndicate and the condominium syndic constitute fundamental components.

## 1 – Scope of application of the condominium law

According to article one of law 18-00, the provisions of said law apply to the ownership of built buildings divided by apartments, floors or premises and whose ownership belonging to several persons is distributed by lots each comprising a private part and a share of the common parts.

They also apply to built real estate complexes and to the various residences consisting of contiguous or separate dwellings having common parts belonging in indivision to all co-owners.

These provisions apply to both registered or in the process of registration buildings as well as those not registered.

Furthermore, according to article 46 of law 18-00, the provisions of this law apply to housing cooperatives and associations. These are required, for this purpose, to develop condominium regulations.

In case of dissolution of the cooperative or association, a syndicate composed of members of the cooperative or association is created by right, due to the existence of common parts allocated to common use.

## 2 – Components of condominium

### 2.1 – Private parts

Are considered as private parts of buildings, the built or unbuilt parts belonging to each co-owner for the purpose of enjoying them individually and personally.

They are the exclusive property of each co-owner.

### 2.2 – Common parts

Are considered as common parts of buildings, the built or unbuilt parts intended for the use and enjoyment of all co-owners or some of them.

**Are deemed common parts:**

- the ground
- the structural work of the building, foundations, load-bearing walls and basements whatever their depth
- the facade of the building
- roofs intended for common use
- stairs, passages and corridors intended for common use
- guardians' and caretakers' lodges
- entrances, basements and elevators intended for common use
- walls and partitions separating two apartments or premises
- common equipment, including the parts thereof that pass through the private parts
- vaults, chimney heads and ventilation outlets intended for common use

**Are also considered as common parts, except stipulation in the property titles or in case of contradiction between these titles:**

- roofs and balconies not initially allocated to individual use
- courtyards and gardens
- premises intended for common use

And in general, any part considered as such or that the nature of the building requires it to be intended for common use.

**Are considered as accessory rights to common parts:**

- the right to raise the building
- the right to erect new constructions in courtyards or gardens and in their basements
- the right of excavation

## 3 – Rights and obligations of co-owners

### 3.1 – Rights of co-owners

#### 3.1.1 – Individual rights

Every co-owner has the right to:

- freely and fully dispose of their divided part of the building as well as the undivided parts attached to it according to its allocation, whether it concerns sale, bequest or others
- access archives, syndicate registers, particularly those relating to the treasury situation
- take legal action to preserve their rights in the condominium building

#### 3.1.2 – Collective rights

**Right of preference:** co-owners may, by a majority of three-quarters of the votes, establish among themselves a right of preference regarding all acts of property transfer and provide for the modalities of exercise of said right and its deadlines in the condominium regulations.

**Right of raising, excavation and reconstruction of the building:** on condition of being authorized by the regulations in force, the exercise of this right must be approved unanimously by the co-owners.

When it concerns partial destruction, the decision to restore the damaged part is made by a majority of three-quarters of the co-owners' votes.

#### 3.1.3 – Rights of tenants

The co-owner who has leased their divided fraction is required to give the tenant a copy of the condominium regulations. The tenant undertakes to respect the regulations of which they have taken knowledge and the decisions made by the co-owners' syndicate. An article covering these stipulations must be inserted in the lease contract.

It should be specified in this regard that the co-owner is personally responsible for paying contributions to charges in case of rental.

### 3.2 – Obligations of co-owners

#### 3.2.1 – Participation in charges

Each of the co-owners is required to participate in charges relating to the conservation, maintenance and management of common parts.

Except for contrary provisions in the condominium regulations, charges relating to the conservation, maintenance and management of common parts are fixed according to the share of each co-owner's divided part in relation to the building.

The modification of the distribution of common charges can only be decided by the general assembly by a majority of three-quarters of the co-owners' votes.

In case a co-owner considers that their participation in charges is higher than their due, they may bring the dispute before the competent court to request its revision.

In this case, the lawsuit is brought against the co-owners' syndicate in the presence, if applicable, of the syndic. In case of transfer of a divided part, the transferee is jointly responsible with the transferor towards the syndicate to guarantee payment of the syndicate's claims due by the transferring member.

The syndicate's claims relating to common charges against co-owners are prescribed, if they are not claimed, within two years from their approval by the general assembly.

#### 3.2.2 – Execution of works on undivided parts

The co-owner, their successors or the occupant must not prohibit works relating to undivided parts decided by the general assembly, even if they are carried out inside the divided parts.

The syndic is required to inform the co-owner or their successors or the occupant, of the nature of the works eight days before their start, unless it concerns urgent works aimed at preserving the safety of the condominium building and that of its occupants.

In case of refusal by one of the co-owners, the dispute may be brought before the emergency judge who may order the execution of necessary works, thus removing the prejudice.

- In case one of the parties refuses to conclude the definitive sales contract within thirty days from the date of the notification referred to above, the injured party may bring legal action for the conclusion of the definitive contract or the termination of the preliminary sales contract

The final judgment ordering the conclusion of the sale is equivalent to a definitive contract.

# SECOND PART

## THE PROPERTY MANAGER AND THEIR MISSION IN CONDOMINIUM MANAGEMENT

# Chapter 1 – The Property Manager

## 1 – Role of the Property Manager

The property manager manages on behalf of the co-owners the assets that are common to them, and executes all the provisions of the condominium regulations for which they are responsible.

Thus, their function encompasses various aspects, namely:

### 1.1 - Legal and Organizational Aspects

- The property manager convenes and organizes the general assembly of co-owners,
- They execute decisions made in this context,
- They enforce the condominium regulations,
- They can initiate legal proceedings against a co-owner or a third party (with authorization from the general assembly),
- They are the permanent representative of the co-owners' syndicate,
- They maintain the condominium archives.

### 1.2 - Financial Aspects

- The property manager manages the condominium's financial resources,
- They allocate charges among co-owners
- They collect provisions for charges,
- They pay suppliers,
- They handle cash flow problems and accounting.
- They present the forecast budget to the general assembly.

### 1.3 - Technical Aspects

The property manager is responsible, for common areas:

- for maintenance of premises;
- for preventive maintenance and repairs;
- They negotiate interventions with different trades and control the execution of work. They submit quotes to the general assembly;
- They manage security or maintenance personnel (concierge).

It should be noted in this regard that the profession of condominium property manager is regulated in several countries.

Thus, in the case of France, the condominium property manager must possess a professional card to be renewed annually and for this, they must:

- justify their professional aptitude to exercise this profession;
- provide a financial guarantee intended to secure the funds held;
- be insured for professional civil liability against pecuniary risks incurred;
- be registered in the commercial register;
- not be subject to a prohibition to practice as defined by law.

As for our country, the function is exercised in most cases by co-owner property managers.

Professional property managers are emerging more and more, but there is no legal obligation to use these property managers and recourse to their services remains quite limited.

Given the legal framework introduced by Law 18-00, the role granted by this Law to the condominium property manager and the need for professional upgrading of this category of stakeholders to enable them to properly fulfill this role, the Ministry of Housing, Urban Planning and Spatial Development has organized a training cycle for this category of stakeholder.

## 2 – Designation of the Property Manager

The property manager and their deputy are designated by the general assembly, from among the co-owners present or represented, by majority vote.

They can be designated, by the same majority, from among third parties and can be a natural or legal person exercising the profession of real estate management in a liberal capacity.

In the absence of the designation of a property manager and their deputy, they are appointed at the request of one or more co-owners by the president of the court of first instance after having informed all co-owners and heard those present among them.

The property manager and their deputy are appointed for a renewable period of two years.

## 3 – Duties of the Property Manager

The property manager is charged in particular with:

- executing the provisions of the condominium regulations for which they are assigned;
- implementing the decisions of the general assembly, unless they are entrusted to the syndical council, to the owners or to third parties;
- ensuring proper use of common areas by ensuring their maintenance, guarding the main entrances of the building and common equipment;
- carrying out urgent repairs even on their own initiative;
- preparing the syndicate's budget project for examination and approval by the general assembly;

- regularly establishing the syndicate's budget and maintaining accounting that shows the cash flow situation of the syndicate and each co-owner;
- communicating the syndicate's cash flow situation to co-owners, at least every three months;
- maintaining archives and registers relating to the building and the syndicate and facilitating access to these documents for all co-owners, particularly before holding the general assembly whose agenda includes examination of the syndicate's accounting;
- undertaking administrative procedures that are recognized to them and those that are delegated to them;
- representing the syndicate in court on special order from the general assembly.

## 4 – The Deputy Property Manager

In case of death of the property manager, their revocation or resignation, the deputy property manager exercises the same duties as the property manager.

The deputy property manager temporarily exercises the same duties in case of refusal by the property manager to fulfill their role or when they inform them of their absence or their intention to cease their functions.

In case of dispute, the property manager and their deputy must refer to a general assembly that meets urgently.

The property manager or their deputy is held responsible for non-performance of their tasks.

## 6 – Remuneration of the Property Manager

The general assembly sets the property manager's fees and, where applicable, their remuneration. In default, they are set by the judicial order appointing the property manager.

# Chapter 2 - The Property Manager's Legal Tools: The Condominium Regulations

## 1 – Role of the Condominium Regulations

The condominium regulations represent the statutes of the condominium syndicate. Article 8 of Law 18-00 stipulates in this regard that any condominium building subject to the provisions of said law is governed by condominium regulations.

The original owner or the co-owners by mutual agreement are required to develop condominium regulations in compliance with the provisions of said law. A copy must be given to each co-owner.

In the absence of condominium regulations, standard condominium regulations apply to them; the regulations are developed through regulatory channels.

Co-owners may prescribe special conditions or specific obligations in the condominium regulations subject to the provisions of the law.

## 2 – Development of the Condominium Regulations

Article 21 stipulates for its part that by a majority of three-quarters of the votes of the co-owners, the general assembly rules on the development of condominium regulations if they are not established or their amendment, as the case may be, particularly for common areas, the conditions of their use and enjoyment.

## 3 – Content of the Condominium Regulations

According to the provisions of Article 9 of Law 18-00, the condominium regulations must include the following elements:

- the purpose of private and common areas and the conditions of their use;
- the definition of rules relating to the administration of common areas and the right of enjoyment thereof;
- the definition of rules for managing the syndicate and holding the general assembly as well as the criteria for designating the property manager and their deputy and, where applicable, the syndical council. However, this latter provision is not mandatory if the number of co-owners is less than eight;
- the allocation of indivision quotas relating to common areas to each divided fraction.

## 4 – Documents Annexed to the Condominium Regulations

Article 10 of Law 18-00 stipulates that the following documents are attached to the condominium regulations:

- architectural plans ne varietur;
- approved topographical plans defining individual and common areas.

## 5 – Filing and Publication of the Condominium Regulations

According to Article 11, the condominium regulations to which are annexed the attached documents and any modifications made in accordance with the law must be, for registered buildings, filed and recorded at the land registry office of the location where the building is situated.

If the building is not registered, the condominium regulations with any modifications possibly made to it are filed at the registry office of the court of first instance in the jurisdiction where the building is located.

# Chapter 3 – The Property Manager's Finances

This chapter will be devoted to certain aspects that are related to the property manager's financial management, namely:

- bank accounts;
- check regulations.

## 1 – Bank Accounts

### 1.1 – Nature of Bank Accounts

Deposit accounts comprise 3 categories:

- **sight deposit accounts**: the funds deposited there can be moved mainly by means of checks, bank transfer orders and bank direct debits;
- **passbook accounts**: only the account holder (or their agent) can dispose of the funds deposited there, by means of the passbook given to them by their bank and which serves as the support for this account;
- **term deposit account**: the account holder can only dispose of the funds deposited there at the maturity agreed upon when opening it. It is possible to obtain an advance on the deposited funds from their bank, by paying interest at a rate higher than that received.

### 1.2 – Opening a Bank Account

Opening conditions differ depending on whether it is a natural person or a legal entity.

Regarding the Co-owners' Syndicate, a legal entity, the necessary documents for opening a bank account are as follows:

- copy of the Condominium Regulations certified as conforming to the original;
- copy of the minutes of the general assembly that elected the property manager and their deputy;
- copies of the national identity cards of the property manager and their deputy;
- receipt of declaration to the local authority of the syndicate's constitution.

## 2 – Bank Check Regulations

Bank checks are governed by articles 239 to 328 of the commercial code.

### 2.1 – Form of the Check

The check must necessarily contain the following information:

- the name of the drawee (the bank responsible for paying the check);
- indication of the place where payment must be made;
- indication of the date and place where the check is created;
- the name and signature of the drawer (the holder of the account on which the check is drawn).

A check not conforming to the forms issued by the banking establishment or in which one of the mandatory statements is missing is deemed not valid as a check.

### 2.2 – Payment of the Check

The check is payable at sight. Any contrary mention is deemed unwritten.

A check presented for payment before the day indicated as the issue date is payable on the day of presentation.

A check without indication of the beneficiary is valid as a bearer check.

A check whose amount is written both in words and in figures is valid, in case of difference, for the sum written in words.

A check whose amount is written several times either in words or in figures is valid, in case of difference, only for the lesser sum.

In these two cases, the bank is required to pay the check in accordance with the aforementioned provisions.

If the provision is less than the amount of the check, the drawee banking establishment is required to offer payment up to the amount of available provision.

The drawee cannot refuse this partial payment.

Any person who submits a check for payment must prove their identity by means of an official document bearing their photograph:

**For natural persons:**

- The national identity card;
- The registration card for resident foreigners;
- The passport or any other piece of identity serving as such for non-resident foreigners.

**For legal entities:**

- The identity of the natural person(s) authorized to carry out the aforementioned operation;
- As well as the corporate tax registration number, commercial register or business license tax.

### 2.3 – Transmission of the Check

A check stipulated payable to the benefit of a named person with or without express "to order" clause is transferable by endorsement.

Endorsement transfers all rights resulting from the check and in particular, ownership of the provision.

### 2.4 – Presentation of the Check

A check issued and payable in Morocco must be presented for payment within twenty days. A check issued outside Morocco and payable in Morocco must be presented within sixty days.

The bank must pay the check even after expiration of the presentation period.

### 2.5 – Certification of the Check

Any check for which the corresponding provision exists at the disposal of the drawer must be certified by the drawee if the drawer or bearer requests it.

The provision of the certified check remains, under the drawee's responsibility, blocked for the bearer's benefit until the end of the presentation period.

Certification results from the drawee's signature on the front of the check. It can only be refused for insufficient provision.

### 2.6 – Crossing of the Check

The drawer or bearer of a check may cross it with the effects indicated below.

Crossing is done by means of two parallel bars placed on the front. It can be general or special.

The crossing is general if it bears no designation between the bars or the mention of a banking establishment or equivalent term. Such a check can only be paid by the bank to one of its customers or to a banking establishment.

It is special if the name of a banking establishment is inscribed between the two bars. Such a check can only be paid by the drawee to the designated banking establishment or, if that one is the drawee, to its customer. However, the designated banking establishment may use another banking establishment for collection.

### 2.7 – Opposition to Payment of a Check

Opposition to payment of a check is only admitted in case of loss, theft, fraudulent use or falsification of the check, receivership or judicial liquidation of the bearer.

The drawer must immediately confirm their opposition in writing regardless of the medium of this writing and support this opposition with any useful document.

### 2.8 - Recourse for Failure to Pay the Check: The Protest

The bearer may exercise their recourse against endorsers, the drawer and other obligors, if the check, presented in due time, is not paid and if the refusal of payment is established by protest.

The protest must be made before expiration of the presentation period. It must be made by the agents of the court registry office at the domicile of the one on whom the check was payable or at their last known domicile.

No act on the part of the check bearer can replace the act of protest, except in cases of loss or theft of the check.

The notification made to the drawer of the protest serves as a demand for payment.

The bearer of the protested check may request an ex parte order authorizing them to proceed with any conservatory seizure against the signatories of the check.

In default of payment upon expiration of a period of thirty days after seizure, the bearer of the check may proceed to sell the seized objects.

All persons obligated under a check are jointly liable to the bearer.

The bearer may claim from the one against whom they exercise their recourse:

- the amount of the unpaid check;
- interest from the day of presentation due at the legal rate for checks issued and payable in Morocco; this rate being increased by 1% for other checks;
- protest fees, those of notices given as well as other fees.

The one who has reimbursed the check may claim from their guarantors:

- the full amount they paid;
- interest on said amount from the day they disbursed it, calculated at the legal rate for checks issued and payable in Morocco, this rate being increased by 1% for other checks;
- the fees borne.

### 2.9 – Prescriptions

The bearer's actions for recourse against endorsers, the drawer and other obligors are prescribed by six months from the expiration of the presentation period.

The actions for recourse of the various obligors to payment of a check against each other are prescribed by six months from the day when the obligor reimbursed the check or from the day when they were themselves sued.

The action of the check bearer against the drawee is prescribed by one year from the expiration of the presentation period.

However, in case of forfeiture or prescription, there remains an action against the drawer who has not provided funds or other obligors who would have been unjustly enriched.

### 2.10 – General and Penal Provisions

- Between merchants and for commercial acts, any payment of a value exceeding ten thousand dirhams must be made by crossed check or by transfer.

Failure to observe these provisions is punishable by a fine whose amount cannot be less than 6% of the value paid.

The creditor and the debtor are jointly liable for payment of this fine.

- A fine of six percent of the check amount, with a minimum of 100 dirhams, is applicable in the following cases:
  - The drawer who issues a check not bearing indication of the place of issue or without date;
  - one who puts a false date on a check;
  - one who draws a check on a person other than a banking establishment.

The same fine is due personally and without recourse by the first endorser or bearer and by the one who pays or receives in compensation a check without indication of the place of issue or without date.

The drawer of a check who omits to maintain or constitute the check's provision for its payment on presentation is liable for the same fine.

- Any banking establishment that refuses payment of a check drawn on its coffers is required to issue to the bearer or their agent a certificate of refusal of payment.

- The drawee banking establishment that has refused payment of a check for lack of sufficient provision must enjoin the account holder to return to all banking establishments of which they are a client, the forms in their possession and that of their agents and to no longer issue, for a period of ten years, checks other than those that allow withdrawal of funds by the drawer from the drawee or those that are certified.

However, provided they do not incur a criminal prohibition, the account holder regains the ability to issue checks when they justify:

- that they have settled the amount of the unpaid check or have constituted sufficient and available provision for its settlement by the drawee;
- that they have paid the tax fine set as follows:
  - 5% of the amount of the unpaid check(s) subject to the first injunction;
  - 10% of the amount of the check(s) subject to the second injunction;
  - 20% of the amount of the check(s) subject to the third injunction and subsequent injunctions.

Is liable to imprisonment of one to five years and a fine of 2,000 to 10,000 dirhams without this fine being able to be less than 25% of the amount of the check or insufficient provision:

- the drawer of a check who omits to maintain or constitute the check's provision for its payment on presentation;
- the drawer of a check who irregularly prohibits the drawee from paying;
- any person who counterfeits or falsifies a check;
- any person who, knowingly, agrees to receive, endorse or guarantee a falsified or counterfeited check;
- any person who, knowingly, uses or attempts to use a counterfeited or falsified check;
- any person who, knowingly, agrees to receive or endorse a check on condition that it not be cashed immediately and that it be kept as a guarantee.

Counterfeited or falsified checks are confiscated and destroyed. The confiscation of materials, machines, apparatus or instruments that served or were intended to serve in the manufacture of said checks will be pronounced by court decision, except when they were used without the owner's knowledge.

- When the drawer of a check without provision has constituted or completed the provision within twenty days of presentation, the imprisonment sentence may be reduced or entirely suppressed, both for them and for all co-authors or accomplices.

- In addition, the court may pronounce against those convicted under the aforementioned offenses, the prohibition for a period of one to five years from issuing checks other than those that exclusively allow withdrawal of funds by the drawer from the drawee or those that are certified.

Is liable to imprisonment of one month to two years and a fine of 1,000 to 10,000 dirhams one who issues checks in contempt of the injunction addressed to them by the bank or in violation of the prohibition pronounced against them by justice.

# Chapter 4 – The Property Manager's Accounting

Accounting is a quantitative management technique that is useful and indispensable for any economic agent regardless of their size, activity and the domain in which they operate.

Maintaining accounting is a legal obligation for merchants.

As for the property manager, the legal framework for maintaining condominium accounting is set by Law 18-00 regulating the condominium of built buildings.

## 1 – General Notions on Accounting

### 1.1 - Definition and Role of Accounting

Accounting is a quantitative management technique that is useful and indispensable for any economic agent regardless of their size, activity and the domain in which they operate.

Maintaining accounting is first a legal obligation. Such is the case, for example, for merchants.

Article 1 of Dahir No. 1-92 of December 25, 1992 promulgating Law No. 9-88 relating to the accounting obligations of merchants, stipulates that "any natural or legal person having the quality of merchant within the meaning of the commercial code is required to keep accounting in the forms prescribed by this law."

Furthermore, Law No. 15-95 forming the commercial code stipulates in its Article 19 that "The merchant keeps accounting in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 9-88 relating to the accounting obligations of merchants promulgated by Dahir No. 1-92-138 of 30 Joumada II 1413 (December 25, 1992)" adding that "If it is regularly maintained, this accounting is admitted by the judge to serve as proof between merchants for commercial acts."

For its part, Article 18 of the same text stipulates that "Any merchant, for the needs of their commerce, has the obligation to open an account in a banking establishment or in a postal check center."

Finally, it is useful to recall the terms of Article 20 of the commercial code which stipulates that "Third parties may oppose to the merchant the content of their accounting even if irregularly maintained."

Professional condominium property managers are merchants and are therefore bound by these legal provisions in the management of their businesses.

For condominium management operations carried out by both professional and volunteer property managers (chosen from among the co-owners), the applicable accounting rules are those set by Law 18-00 and will be studied in the second paragraph of this chapter.

Accounting is also a management tool that allows business leaders as well as third parties (suppliers, customers, shareholders, banking and financial relations...) to know the situation of the business and assess its management.

### 1.2 – Maintaining Accounting

Maintaining accounting must satisfy the following rules:

- Keep accounting in national currency;
- Adopt the double-entry technique guaranteeing the arithmetic equality of debit and credit movements of accounts and the resulting balances;
- Rely on dated supporting documents, preserved, classified in a defined order, capable of serving as means of proof and bearing references to their recording in accounting;
- Respect chronological recording of operations;
- Maintain supporting books allowing establishment of end-of-period synthesis statements provided for by regulations in force;
- Allow reliable accounting control contributing to preventing errors and fraud and protecting assets;
- Control by inventory the existence and value of active and passive elements;
- Allow for each accounting record to know its origin, content, classification by nature, summary qualification as well as the reference of the supporting document that supports it.

### 1.3 - Accounting Media

The basic accounting media are as follows:

- **The journal book** maintained under conditions prescribed by law in which operations are recorded day by day and operation by operation;
- **The general ledger** formed by all individual and collective accounts that allows tracking of these accounts. Each account distinctly shows the balance at the beginning of the period, the cumulative debit and credit movements since the beginning of the period as well as its balance at the end of the period;
- **The trial balance** showing for each account the balance at the beginning of the period, the cumulative debit and credit movements since the beginning of the period, and the balance at the end of the period;
- **The inventory book** in which the balance sheet and profit and loss account of each period are transcribed.

### 1.4 - Recording Procedures – Principle of Double-Entry Accounting

Any accounting operation is translated by an entry affecting at least two accounts, one of which is credited and the other is debited.

When an operation is recorded, the totals of amounts entered as credit and debit must be strictly equal.

Entries are recorded in the journal in chronological order, and reported in the general ledger. The totals of movements in both documents must be equal.

The journal must be maintained without blanks or alterations of any kind.

Entries are made in the journal operation by operation and day by day. However, operations of the same nature carried out in the same place and during the same day may be grouped and recorded in the same entry.

Any error correction must leave the initial erroneous recording legible. Accounting must be organized such that corrections are made by negative number or by counter-entry. Accounting by negative amount is only admitted for error correction.

## 2 – Maintaining Accounting for the Co-owners' Syndicate

### 2.1 – Legal Framework for Maintaining Condominium Accounting

Article 24 of Law 18-00 stipulates that:

- The syndicate's accounts comprising the forecast budget, charges and income for the period, the cash flow situation, as well as annexes to the forecast budget are established in accordance with specific accounting rules set by regulatory means.
- The accounts are presented with comparison to the accounts of the previous approved period;
- The syndicate's charges and income, provided for in the accounting plan, are recorded as soon as they are committed by the syndicate regardless of their settlement or as soon as products are received by it. The commitment is settled by payment.

Article 26 of the same law specifies for its part, that among the missions assigned to the property manager are the following:

- to prepare the syndicate's budget project for examination and approval by the general assembly;
- to collect co-owners' contributions to charges against receipt;
- to issue a receipt to the co-owner in case of sale if they are not a debtor to the syndicate;
- to regularly establish the syndicate's budget and maintain accounting showing the cash flow situation of the syndicate and each co-owner;
- to communicate the syndicate's cash flow situation to co-owners, at least every three months;
- to maintain archives and registers relating to the building and syndicate and facilitate access to these documents for all co-owners, particularly before holding the general assembly whose agenda includes examination of the syndicate's accounting.

It is worth recalling in this regard the provisions of Article 32 of the same Law which stipulate that any co-owner has the right of access to archives, syndicate registers, particularly those relating to the cash flow situation.

### 2.2 – Nature of Accounting Operations Relating to the Co-owners' Syndicate

The co-owners' syndicate accounts consist of two categories:

- Accounts relating to condominium management and administration;
- Accounts relating to the syndicate's financial situation.

#### 2.2.1 – Accounts Relating to Condominium Management and Administration

Condominium management and administration requires:

- commitment of expenses called charges;
- collection of receipts called income.

##### 2.2.1.1 – Charges

Charges comprise all expenses made on behalf of condominium management. They include in particular:

- water and electricity consumption charges;
- personnel charges (concierge, gardener, cleaning lady, ...);
- allowances paid to the condominium property manager;
- maintenance and upkeep costs for common areas;
- syndicate administration charges;
- other fees and charges.

##### 2.2.1.2 – Income

Income comprises receipts generated by condominium management. They consist particularly of the following items:

- Co-owners' contribution to charges;
- Rental income;
- Financial income;
- Income generated by the use of common areas by third parties;
- other income.

#### 2.2.2 – Accounts of the Syndicate's Financial Situation

These accounts comprise:

- The syndicate's general accounts, composed of the cash situation, the bank account situation, as well as the situation of receivables and debts;
- Individual accounts of each co-owner representing their financial situation vis-à-vis the syndicate.

### 2.3 – Technical Aspects of Maintaining Accounting

#### 2.3.1 – Rules to Observe

Maintaining accounting must satisfy the following rules:

**Recording operations day by day on accounting media**

Operations must be recorded at the latest at the end of the day when they were carried out, on appropriate accounting media provided for this purpose, namely:

- The journal book;
- The general ledger;

**Adopt the double-entry accounting technique.**

This technique guarantees the arithmetic equality of debit and credit movements of accounts and the resulting balances.

Thus, accounting for an expense will be done as follows:

- on the debit side: the charge account concerned by the expense;
- on the credit side: the cash account moved for settlement of this expense.
